The patient initially required control of her congestive heart failure in preparation for general anesthetic and BK amputation of the left leg."

RECOMMENDATIONS: We will need to take the patient directly to the Heart Catheterization Laboratory."
SA,MISTAKE:Oncotype DX,The patient did not have any lymphovascular invasion however the margins were positive. The patient underwent reexcision. Her primary pathology reveals negative HER2 receptor. Her uncle type SA showed low risk of recurrence to be about 5% over the next 10 years according to Dr. _%#NAME#%_. It was decided to not proceed chemotherapy and use Arimidex after her radiation is finished to her right breast.
SA,American Society of Anesthesiologists:ASA,We are currently holding her aspirin and have discontinued her Detrol secondary to no real benefit seen in this with her.

BMP,beta-natriuretic peptide:BNP,"His respiratory distress is most likely multifactorial in etiology. His clinical presentation, the initial chest x-ray, and the traumatically elevated BMP are all consistent with acute superimposed on chronic heart failure. He has had a good diuresis with greater than a nine pound weight loss over the course of the past five days, and his creatinine has remained relatively stable."
BMP,bone marrow transplant:BMT,"On the day of discharge, his white count was 3.9 and his hemoglobin 9.6 and platelet count 26 and he was instructed to followup in BMP clinic the following day for a possible platelet transfusion. 3.

CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"If indeed she has resolution of her symptoms, then I think she would be able to avoid surgery. There is some concern with her minimally elevated CEA level, and that will need to be taken into consideration as we move along. She should be at fairly low risk for recurrence of her previous colon cancer, though certainly there is some possibility of having a new colon cancer in her remaining colon; and colonoscopy might be considered."
CEA,UNSURED SENSE,"Scaled scores between 9 and 11 ar4e considered average. _%#NAME#%_'s ability to recall verbal information presented in the context of short stories was age-appropriate, both immediately (SS = 11) and after a longer delay (SS = 11).

CT of her head on admission to the emergency department showed old changes with possible old CEA of the left frontal lobe, no acute changes. Ultrasound of lower extremity showed right posterior tibial vein thrombus and right Baker's cyst."

AB,atrioventricular:AV,"I suspect this is related to implantation of his AICD and this was also shown in the MADIT II trial that, despite a survival benefit, many of the patients had worsening congestive heart failure and this is most likely due to the fact that he has a fair amount of pacing which is wide complex which is less efficient. We will have his pacemaker reprogrammed to decrease the rate and increase the AB delay such that he paces less frequently. 4. He appears to be responding to Lasix already. I will, as he is in the hospital with decreased left ventricular function, put him on a course of Natrecor to tune him up."
