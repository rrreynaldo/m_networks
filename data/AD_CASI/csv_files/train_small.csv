20867,CVA,cerebrovascular accident,The significance of the history that the patient has not been taking his medications reliably for the last few days is not clear. I certainly doubt that the syncopal episode represented either a primary neurologic event such as a CVA or seizure or a primary cardiac event. The patient currently feels quite well and feels ready to be discharged back to the Lodging Plus unit.

In addition, there was a large right ventricular apex mass consistent with a thrombus. This is a small posterior pericardiac effusion of uncertain significance."
9786,PDA,patent ductus arteriosus,"Her last chest x-ray on _%#DDMM2007#%_ showed borderline cardiomegaly, but was otherwise normal. Problem #3: Cardiovascular. Because of a murmur that was heard intermittently, _%#NAME#%_ had an echocardiogram on _%#DDMM2007#%_ which revealed a small PDA with minimal left to right shunting, a small patent foramen ovale with minimal shunting, and multiple small mid-muscular and apical-muscular defects in the ventricular septum."

He will be discharged home later today and follow-up with _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, NP in approximately two weeks as well as a follow-up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in approximately three months. If he has any problems in the interim, I would certainly be happy to see him sooner."
21940,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Many of the symptoms might be accounted for with this diagnosis, although there are obviously other explanations as well. He could have low platelet counts due to ITP, but that would not fit with his recent onset fever and rigors. 2. Anemia, which is likely multifactorial, including blood loss. His reticulocyte count, however, is inappropriately low, however, may suggest other causes including anemia due to impaired iron mobilization, such as with chronic inflammation or even a primary bone marrow disorder."

22085,AV,atrioventricular,"There seems to be something particular about these child that predisposes them top complete AV block, as even children without surgery but who have Down syndrome seem to be at increased risk of heart block. At this point, I cannot predict whether _%#NAME#%_ will progress to complete AV block, but he does seem to fit 2 criteria for pacemaker implantation. I would recommend that he have a single chamber epicardial ventricular pacemaker placed, at a time that suits the otolaryngologist, because he will need to be re-intubated."

He has a recent right BK amputation. He was able to move his left leg fairly well and lift it from the bed slightly and wiggle his toes.
9405,PA,pulmonary artery,"In the meantime, he should continue on all his current medications. I will obtain an echocardiogram for further assessment of his biventricular function as well as PA pressures. Further recommendations may follow."
1023,IVF,intravenous fluid,"He is also on amiodarone and could be some concern for toxicity given his slight bumps in his LFTs as well as prolonged QT. Will recheck EKG in the a.m. Based on most recent documented EF of 50%, will administer IVF cautiously and follow pulmonary sx/exam closely for signs of pulmonary edema. PROBLEM # 5: Right-sided pleural effusion c/w exudate. Cirrhosis versus pancreatic CA vs. lung cancer are possible etiologies."
20044,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"The mesentery feeding this area was very foreshortened. The mass at the base of the mesentery was large and quite a bit larger than it seemed on CT scan for some reason. I felt it was worth trying to see if we could dissect down into this region to better understand its relationship to the SMA just to be sure that this wasn't potentially resectable. With that in mind, we identified the middle colic vessels and then stayed just to the left of that vessel."

24577,ASA,acetylsalicylic acid,"There was concern that perhaps the patient's epigastric discomfort may have been related to her Pentasa, which she had taken one dose of prior to admission. There was some question during the patient's past episode of pancreatitis that perhaps Asacol had been related to this, so perhaps the patient has some side effects from five ASA compounds? In regards to the patient's mild lipase elevation, this decreased to approximately 250 by the day of discharge."
27442,AC,adriamycin cyclophosphamide,She had a 1.3. and 1.2 cm sized primary lesion with a DCIS and one of two axillary nodes positive. The sentinel node with extracapsular extension.

However, on exam and by history he had no localizing infectious symptoms other than his recent diagnosis of possible SBP. Infectious Disease was consulted to see whether this was contaminant or representing true pathogenic bacteremia. They felt this was likely contaminant because enterococcus can be a contaminant and there is two different species also consistent with a contaminant."

I do not see any skin rash. We will obtain urine to rule out UTI."
10579,GT,gastrostomy tube,"Then 0.1 mg GT q. 8 hours from _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_ to _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_. Then decrease to 0.1 mg GT b.i.d. from _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_ to _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_. He should be off (?Activin) on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2002. 12. Metamucil 36 mg, which is 0.4 cc GT q.d."
26322,IR,interventional radiology,"Radiology was consulted regarding placement of PNT; however, they were unsuccessful in doing so. Therefore, the patient underwent a CT guided PNT placement by IR Radiology. The patient underwent reimplantation of the transplanted ureter on _%#MMDD2004#%_. The patient's hemodialysis was discontinued around _%#MMDD2004#%_. This was secondary to increasing urine output and incremental drop in the patient's creatinine and BUN."

Respiratory: An ABG and CXR were obtained on admission due to _%#NAME#%_'s respiratory status and found to be normal. _%#NAME#%_ was placed on supplemental O2 and was weaned quickly to RA. She was able to maintain adequate oxygenation on RA. It is likely that the initial respiratory distress was due to delayed intrauterine transition. She had no respiratory distress with feedings. 3. ID: A sepsis evaluation was done on admission.
9618,PDA,patent ductus arteriosus,"The proximal LAD stent was open. The second obtuse marginal branch had a subtotal occlusion that was evident on the _%#DDMM2002#%_ exam.

22705,IB,international baccalaureate,"As a result, she is concerned about her interaction with her family. This patient is currently in the 11th grade at Patrick Henry High School. She is in the IB program and finds it to be challenging. Right now she tends to get A's and B's and believes that her ranking is somewhere in the top 5-10% of her class."
24864,C3,cervical (level) 3,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 57-year-old female who presented on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2002 with decreased mentation and neck pain, noted to have an epidural abscess which was drained at Fairview Southdale Hospital by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_. She underwent a laminectomy from C3 through T2. The patient is intubated and unresponsive and on IV antibiotics. She has cultured positive for Strep.

If the patient needs an agent in this class of medications, TZD agents, will switch him to Actos For now, though we will hold the medication"
16188,NP,nurse practitioner,"She is presenting with first episode of hemetemesis. The patient was seen in GI Clinic by _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, NP yesterday. She was complaining of her first episode of vomiting out some blood clots. At the time it was decided that the patient should have an outpatient upper endoscopy for further evaluation."
18615,BM,bowel movement,"Scan for 116 to 387 cc yesterday. Had incontinent episode, continue ICP and teaching. May want a condom catheter at night. GASTROINTESTINAL: Last BM was on _%#MMDD2005#%_. SKIN: Clear. PSYCHOLOGIC: He answers short questions, is sleepy. NEUROLOGIC: Increased tone, 3-/4, on an Ashworth scale."
9849,PDA,posterior descending artery,"As noted above, this showed that his saphenous venous graft placed in 2001 to the OM was now occluded. However, the LIMA to the LAD and remaining saphenous venous graft to the right PDA were patent. An attempt was made to perform PCI in the native OM1 which was partially successful with balloon angioplasty."
26194,IR,interventional radiology,The patient's pain likely had a behavioral component to it as he did have anxiety over his line removal and replacement done in IR. At this time there is not a concrete diagnosis for his abdominal pain and vomiting. PROBLEM # 6: Hematology. The patient's anemia was treated with Epogen given during his dialysis runs.

14186,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"Therefore, a maternal serum alpha fetoprotein is recommended at 16 weeks gestation. ? I explained that some couples prefer the definitive information provided by amniocentesis or CVS. Other couples may be uncomfortable with the risk of miscarriage and are sufficiently reassured by screening options. I emphasized that prenatal testing decisions are personal decisions and each couple must make the choice that is right for them."
3184,DC,direct current,"The patient was not loaded, rather will have low-dose amiodarone. I anticipate DC cardioversion in approximately one month. He will have Cardiology visit in three to four weeks and DC cardioversion arranged thereafter."
24268,CA,cancer,"However, elevated liver tests were found as well as a lipase of greater than 40,000. The patient denies any new meds. She is treated for hypertension, depression, and has had breast CA. She denies any alcohol intake. In addition, the patient was told she is anemia on this admission."
24689,ASA,American Society of Anesthesiologists,"Recent creatinine was normal. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, really no significant ST-T wave changes. ASSESSMENT: A 54-year-old gentleman here for preoperative exam with total hip replacement planned. He would be an ASA II for surgery. Right now, his diabetes seems to be under decent control with a hemoglobin A1C 8.4 two months ago but better improvement since then."
2949,DC,discontinue,"At this point I have recommended some changes in his medications to try to better limit his exposure to these issues. I am going to ask for neuro checks every shift. We will DC his Dilaudid, Percocet and Valium and start him on OxyContin 10 mg b.i.d. with Vicodin prn for break-through pain and Vistaril as ordered."
14911,EC,enteric-coated,The results of this will need to be followed up by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in Cardiology Clinic in one month's time. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Bonola (??) 10 mg p.o. q.d. 2.

28393,T4,thyroxine,"Now with the transplant, it should be correcting soon. Her albumin level is low normal and hopefully with replacing albumin cc for cc, per transplant orders, this should correct soon. 4. Hypothyroidism. The patient is on Synthroid, and TSH and T4 were fine on _%#MMDD2003#%_. 5. Steroid-induced diabetes: She is on prednisone taper, which should help. Also we will check Accu-Chek and cover with sliding-scale insulin p.r.n."
11654,BMP,basic metabolic profile,"Consequently, the patient will go home with this drain in place after Dr. _%#NAME#%_ did review today. LABORATORY DATA: There is a BMP, hemoglobin, and zinc level pending from this morning on _%#MMDD2004#%_. On _%#MMDD2004#%_ hemoglobin A1c 5.7. Phosphorus 4.2. Magnesium 2.1. BMP within normal limits at that point with a glucose noted to 158, and calcium 7.5. On _%#MMDD2004#%_ hemoglobin 9.9. On _%#MMDD2004#%_ transferrin 145 and albumin 2.5."
29471,ER,emergency room,"Patient's wife, _%#NAME#%_, is followed by me. Information obtained entirely from wife, office record and the case was discussed with the ER physician.

1610,SS,single strength,"It showed heavy growth of two strains of Methicillin-resistant staph aureus. Therefore, his discharge plan will be the same except for an addition of Bactrim SS, 1 tab p.o. b.i.d. x7 days. I did discuss the fact that the patient lists an allergy to sulfa with a reaction of depression."
11526,OR,operating room,"HOSPITAL COURSE: This patient was referred to Dr. _%#NAME#%_ at the University of Minnesota for repair of the above. On _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, he was taken to the OR and the procedure was performed without complication. Postoperatively, he came to the intensive care unit where he was admitted for cardiopulmonary monitoring and resuscitation."
20537,PD,peritoneal dialysis,"Increase in creatinine and BUN with poor urine output despite the Bumex drip. Continued oxygen need and electrolyte abnormalities. He was transferred to the pediatric ICU following PD catheter placement on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006, for initiation PD. He was transferred back to 5A on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006.

24377,CA,carbohydrate antigen,"This was ER positive and weekly progesterone receptor positive, was negative for HER2 by FISH analysis. The patient had some laboratory studies on _%#MMDD2007#%_ with a CBC, which was unremarkable; however, her CA 2729 tumor marker came back markedly elevated at 654. I believe this was an unanticipated finding. On _%#MMDD2007#%_, probably as a result of bilateral breast cancer and the markedly elevated CA 2729, Dr. _%#NAME#%_ ordered a PET CT scan."
11794,BMP,basic metabolic profile,"Vent is set at SMIV 850/8/5/5 40% FiO2. LABORATORY: Significant for a hemoglobin of 9.4, previously 11.2. An INR of 2.18. BMP had a BUN of 77 and a creatinine of 1.46. Remainder of the BMP was normal. AVG was 7.25/38/26/16. HOSPITAL COURSE: PROBLEM #1: Urology. The patient came in with gross hematuria that was controlled after cystoscopy was cauterized."
20275,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,There is also a mild wall thickening of the cecum with known pericecal inflammatory changes. IMPRESSION: I think we can unify the clinical presentation is being caused spine some type of proximal thrombosis with emboli of the SMA and renal arteries and the cecal inflammation is probably therefore due to ischemia rather than IBD. The patient does have a remote history of breast cancer and that would raise concern about recurrence.
27519,AC,(drug) AC,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Zithromax 250 mg one daily for one day only. 2. Lasix 40 mg one p.o. in the morning and 20 mg at bedtime. 3. Robitussin AC 5 to 10 ml p.o. q 6h p.r.n. for cough. 4. Synthroid 100 mcg one daily. 5. Lopressor 50 mg one p.o. b.i.d.

15279,PE,pulmonary embolus,LABORATORY DATA: A D-dimer assay was performed and was slightly elevated at 0.8 (normal up to 0.5). IMPRESSION: Questionable right upper lobe filling defect seen on CT with PE protocol. At present this is being empirically treated as if it were a PE. It does not explain her chest wall discomfort and she has no hemoptysis or hypoxemia. Excluding a pulmonary embolism is important to make a decision about long-term anticoagulation.
24873,C3,propionylcarnitine,"In addition, she is to follow up with the primary physicians, if she has any concerns regarding the patient's development, growth, and management. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: _%#NAME#%_ is a 6-day-old term new born female who was discovered on the Minnesota new born screen to have an elevated C3 acylcarnitine level of 10.85 with a normal level being less than 5.25.

23281,ES,extra strength,"Throughout this time TPN was weaned from postoperative day #7 through postoperative day #9. On postoperative day #9 patient was switched to oral antibiotics, Augmentin ES 100. This formulation was chosen to help decrease diarrhea. At this point, patient's GI function had completely stabilized, was taking breast milk without any emesis."
11323,OR,operating room,"He also had mild abdominal pain. He also had some hypertensive episodes, and Norvasc was started. He continued to improve until _%#DDMM2002#%_ when he developed severe abdominal pain. He was taken back to the OR and had primary repair of small bowel perforation.

At that time a nuclear stress test was performed and showed atrial scarring versus thinning. No further evaluation for cardiac ischemia was made. Because of the patient's pneumonia at that time she was treated for her COPD and pneumonia and no further evaluation or treatment for her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was made."
18115,AMA,against medical advice,"The patient was in the ICU until _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2003, when the patient left AMA.

1510,SA,sinuatrial,"This also could be related to just his respiratory arrest that could have been from a cardiac cause, as he does have a history of underlying tachycardia. At this time, he has no evidence, by his EKG or rhythm strips, of any sort of AV nodal or SA nodal dysfunction, or evidence for any reentrant tachycardia. There is no other prolongation of the QT. However, given his respiratory arrest, the likelihood of this either relating to his acute lung injury versus a specific cardiac issue, is one that needs to be delineated."
