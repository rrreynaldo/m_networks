2513,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"On _%#MMDD2006#%_, we performed an MR angiogram, which really did not show any difference. Still some wall thickening of the distal small bowel with no evidence of obstruction of the SMA or IMA vessels.

Both procedures allow for direct fetal chromosomal analysis with 99% accuracy. CVS is offered at 11-13 weeks' gestation and amniocentesis is offered after 15 weeks' gestation. Due to their invasive nature, CVS is associated with a 1:200 (0.5%) to 1:100 (1.0%) risk of miscarriage and amniocentesis is nationally associated with a 1:200 (0.5%) risk of miscarriage."

1777,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"She reported no smoking, alcohol use or medications during her pregnancy aside from prenatal vitamins. She had an amniocentesis with her previous pregnancy and desired earlier screening, which would be CVS, which was planned today with Dr. _%#NAME#%_.

HOSPITAL COURSE: He was seen by Neurology who recommended aspirin."
1080,MSSA,methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus,"Considering her recent MSSA infection, I think it is appropriate to treat her slightly more broadly. We will give her Zosyn and Levofloxin to cover her MSSA and community-acquired pneumonia. We will await the results of the blood cultures as well as obtain sputum culture. PROBLEM #2: Recent pulmonary embolism. We will recheck the patient's INR."
2696,FISH,fluorescent in situ hybridization,The biopsy on _%#MMDD#%_ revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma grade 2. The tumor was estrogen and progesterone receptor positive and was negative for HER-2 by FISH analysis. There was also an ultrasound-guided biopsy of a left axillary enlarged and this revealed replacement by tumor cells. The pathologist was not able to determine whether this represented within the tail of the breast or in a residual lymph node.
472,MP,mercaptopurine,"The patient tolerated his initial chemotherapy quite well and also received prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate. Prior to discharge he was continuing to tolerate chemotherapy well and the plan was to discharge him and have him continue the chemotherapy with oral 6-mercaptopurine (MP), cytarabine and Cytoxan as an outpatient.

She was hospitalized at Fairview University Hospital just a little over one week ago for abdominal swelling and variceal bleeding. She had banding at the time. SBP was also found. She was started on IV antibiotics. She has been at the _%#CITY#%_ Health Center receiving IV antibiotics since then."
3575,MR,magnetic resonance,"He is admitted after recent laboratory studies were obtained in the clinic after he presented with symptoms of a two week history of left hip pain. Apparently a plane film was negative and further MR scan may have been done on an outpatient basis, results of which we are not clear on. In the meantime, he had blood work done at the clinic and was told to come for hospitalization because of a potassium of about 6 and an elevated creatinine."
1057,MSSA,modified selective severity assessment,PLAN: 1. The patient will return to see his primary care physician for follow up of TSH level and thyroid adjustment if necessary. 2. Encourage the patient to see an optometrist for evaluation of eye correction. 3. Continue MSSA protocol. I anticipate blood pressure normalization with resolution of mild alcohol withdrawal syndrome. 4. Patient to have recheck of LFTs in approximately two weeks to confirm normalization.
1174,PA,physician assistant,"Otherwise, her central nervous system exam seemed intact, though the lateral antibrachial cutaneous nerve had some dysthesia, as well.

Subsequently she went back into sinus rhythm as noted above. Her PR interval was normal. QRS is normal. This is a complex combination of events. I believe this woman has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, likely sick sinus syndrome and a tendency both to tachycardia and bradycardia."
3655,ER,emergency room,"MUSCULOSKELETAL: The patient states he has chronic left-sided weakness. It is unclear if this is related to his CVI in 1999 or possibly due to arthritis as he complains of chronic left hip pain. Chest x-ray reveals hyperinflated lungs. No acute infiltrate. Hip and pelvic x-rays per ER report reveal right superior pubic ramus fracture. LABORATORY DATA: INR 0.96, white count 11.8, hemoglobin 14.7, platelets 272,000."

Secondary to constipation (no BM for the past four days), she stopped taking her narcotics and switched to Tylenol yesterday noon. Her last dose of Tylenol was last night. This morning she woke up with increased pain and secondary to not having a bowel movement, she presented herself to the emergency room for further evaluation."

I discussed the indications, risks and alternatives of angiography and angioplasty with the patient and he elected to proceed. I will try to arrange that for today. 2. Bradycardia with pause.

2477,CVP,central venous pressure,"Postoperatively the patient was admitted to the ICU due to oliguria in the operating room. She was at the ICU for CVP monitoring and serial hemoglobin monitoring. On postoperative day 1, the pain was not well-controlled by PCA. This was improved by increasing her basal rate. Otherwise drain output was appropriate."
1199,PA,posterior-anterior,"Troponin < 0.07. BNP was 91. TSH was normal at 4.57. An electrocardiogram showed moderate voltage, and otherwise was unremarkable. PA and lateral chest x-ray showed some haziness in the left hilum, otherwise unremarkable. CT scan with contrast showed some mild ground glass infiltrate, but no evidence of pulmonary emboli, although the study was limited secondary to the prosthetic right shoulder joint causing artifact on the CT, but they were confident that there were none in the main pulmonary artery nor in the first subdivisions."
1274,BK,below knee,"LUNGS: Are clear to auscultation and percussion. Respiratory rate 12 per minute and in no distress. Normal bilateral femoral pulsations.

In reviewing her recent chest x-rays, she did have a chest x-ray on _%#MMDD2007#%_, which shows hazy coarse opacities through both lungs which suggested possible edema superimposed on BPD with an increasing heart size."
1418,OR,operating room,"If the patient continues to require blood transfusions an/or if he becomes hemodynamically unstable he will need to be taken to the OR for cystoscopy with clot evacuation. Since his surgery was so recently performed we would rather try to hold off on this, however, as not to disrupt the anastomosis with his new transplanted kidney."
1560,RT,respiratory therapy,"She was actually given a dose of Solu-Medrol, but I did not suspect that she needed stress dose steroids at this point in time as there was no significant bronchospasms. Sputum cultures were attempted but not obtainable even despite RT induction. She had done quite well and her oxygen was tapered down. She was 98% on 1 liter on the day of discharge and will be discontinued completely off O2."

After admission and blood cultures were done, he was started on Rocephin and Zithromax."
579,LE,lower extremity,"Since the patient has a strong family history of coronary artery disease and she is a smoker, we ruled out MI with serial EKGs and troponins x 3.

2295,AMA,antimitochondrial antibody,"Would also recommend obtaining the liver biopsy specimen from St. Vincent's Hospital for review here. It would be reasonable to recheck the autoimmune markers such as AMA antimitochondrial antibody, ANA antinuclear antibody and ASMA antismooth muscle antibody. Would check a TSH as well.

I explained the following with respect to his procedure: 1. His anesthesiologist needs to be aware that he has a neuromuscular disorder and that a genetically determined myopathy cannot be excluded at present."

701,CTA,computed tomographic angiography,"ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: CT of the head is reviewed, which reveals the aforementioned findings of subarachnoid hemorrhage, which in all likelihood is traumatic, but given its distribution in the sylvian fissure, and the fact that he does not remember the precipitating events or the accident, I do think it would be prudent to obtain a CTA to rule out an underlying aneurysm. He will need physical therapy, occupational therapy, and a cognitive evaluation, and certainly could be discharged to home if that is negative."
1708,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,MRI was reviewed by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ who felt it was reasonable for her to discharge from the hospital. No surgical intervention was done during the hospitalization. Chemotherapy with VAD was administered without significant complications.
