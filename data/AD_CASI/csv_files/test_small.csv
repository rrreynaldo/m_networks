ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: In summary, Mr. _%#NAME#%_ is a 25-year- old male with a T2 medulloblastoma, status post resection, and now presents for evaluation for postoperative radiation therapy. We agree that the patient would be a candidate for radiation, and Dr. _%#NAME#%_ personally led a discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to radiation therapy with the patient."
2513,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,"She had a genetic study done for SMA, which was still pending at the end of her hospitalization. Because her symptoms aren't typical for SMA, it was recommended that she get an MRI as an outpatient. Her tone was generally considered to be improved by the end of her hospitalization but was still lower than normal for her age."

1783,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,The absence of any such markers can provide reassurance. Level II ultrasound cannot definitively diagnose or exclude the presence of any chromosome condition. * I explained that some couples prefer the definitive information provided by amniocentesis or CVS. Other couples may be uncomfortable with the risk of miscarriage and are sufficiently reassured by screening options. I emphasized that prenatal testing decisions are personal decisions and each couple must make the choice that is right for them.
2127,AVR,aortic valve replacement,2. A left below the knee amputation (BKA) secondary to chronic osteomyelitis which was done _%#MMDD2004#%_. 3. Status post aortic valve replacement (AVR) for which he is on Coumadin and that has been managed by the Coumadin Clinic with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5.

Since his diagnosis of DIP in _%#MM#%_ 2007, he was started on high-dose steroids and had significant improvement in his PFTs and actually had his best FEV-1 since transplant."
1775,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"It was explained to _%#NAME#%_ that because of the invasive nature of the prenatal testing options, they are associated with a risk of miscarriage. The risk for CVS is between 1:200 (0.5%) and 1:100 (1.0%) and the risk for miscarriage with amniocentesis is nationally quoted as 1:200 (0.5%). Karyotype results obtained from these procedures are received approximately 10-14 days after the procedure."
33,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"Given the history of pattern, this most likely represents active demyelination. Minimum nonspecific biventricular white matter changes.

If the patient is eating better, reduce insulin doses and cover in addition with sliding scale."
1226,PDA,posterior descending artery,"I told him that if his angina continues to be at risk that he should not wait that long. I would plan to graft the LAD and diagonal of the internal mammary artery and use the right radial artery for bypassing the PDA and the PLA and possibly vein for the obtuse marginal branch, although it is possible that bypassing that would result in competitive blood flow and either the graft, native artery or both might clot off."
2547,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"The patient was instructed to take a regular diet and to follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in the Heme/Onc Clinic in 6 weeks and to follow up with repeat SMA 10 to assess renal function prior to his appointment with Dr. _%#NAME#%_. The patient was instructed to notify medical doctor if he experienced chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, fever, chills, pain or cough."

1795,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"Both procedures allow for direct fetal chromosomal analysis with 99% accuracy. CVS is offered at 11-13 weeks' gestation and amniocentesis is offered after 15 weeks' gestation. Due to their invasive nature, CVS is nationally associated with a 1:200 (0.5%) to 1:100 (1.0%) risk of miscarriage and amniocentesis is nationally associated with a 1:200 (0.5%) risk of miscarriage."
