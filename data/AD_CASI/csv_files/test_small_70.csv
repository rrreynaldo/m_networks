1783,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,The absence of any such markers can provide reassurance. Level II ultrasound cannot definitively diagnose or exclude the presence of any chromosome condition. * I explained that some couples prefer the definitive information provided by amniocentesis or CVS. Other couples may be uncomfortable with the risk of miscarriage and are sufficiently reassured by screening options. I emphasized that prenatal testing decisions are personal decisions and each couple must make the choice that is right for them.

1775,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"It was explained to _%#NAME#%_ that because of the invasive nature of the prenatal testing options, they are associated with a risk of miscarriage. The risk for CVS is between 1:200 (0.5%) and 1:100 (1.0%) and the risk for miscarriage with amniocentesis is nationally quoted as 1:200 (0.5%). Karyotype results obtained from these procedures are received approximately 10-14 days after the procedure."

If the patient is eating better, reduce insulin doses and cover in addition with sliding scale."
1226,PDA,posterior descending artery,"I told him that if his angina continues to be at risk that he should not wait that long. I would plan to graft the LAD and diagonal of the internal mammary artery and use the right radial artery for bypassing the PDA and the PLA and possibly vein for the obtuse marginal branch, although it is possible that bypassing that would result in competitive blood flow and either the graft, native artery or both might clot off."
2547,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"The patient was instructed to take a regular diet and to follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in the Heme/Onc Clinic in 6 weeks and to follow up with repeat SMA 10 to assess renal function prior to his appointment with Dr. _%#NAME#%_.

1779,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,Patients who elect to forgo modified sequential screening should still be offered maternal serum AFP screening for spina bifida in the second trimester. * I explained that some couples prefer the definitive information provided by amniocentesis or CVS. Other couples may be uncomfortable with the risk of miscarriage and are sufficiently reassured by screening options. I emphasized that prenatal testing decisions are personal decisions and each couple must make the choice that is right for them.
2283,AMA,against medical advice,"Our plan was to increase his beta-blockade and repeat a transesophageal echocardiogram in 3 days.

1580,RT,respiratory therapy,I suspect that some of her lower extremity edema may be related to this. She has left-sided atelectasis but cannot rule out an infiltrate. We will ask RT to attempt to get a sputum. For now I would hold off on any further broadening of her antibiotics as she is afebrile and has normal white counts.
252,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"NEURO: Strength 5/5 bilaterally with the exception of the left wrist and hand which were not tested due to pain. MUSCULOSKELETAL: The DIP, PIP, MCP, wrist, elbow, glenohumeral, acromioclavicular, TMJ, sternoclavicular, knee, subtalar, tibial talar, MTP and toe IP joints bilaterally were all examined and found to be normal with the exception of the left wrist which was red, warm and had a grade II effusion."
3569,MR,myocardial infarction:MI,On the day of admission he had severe chest pressure which quite frightened him and brought him here. He ruled out for an MR. His initial cardiac echo was normal and his EKG was normal. He did have a couple of very mild episodes of his chest pressure.

2732,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Splenic sequestration could also explain her mild chronic leukopenia as well. Alternative explanations for the thrombocytopenia could include decreased destruction such as with chronic ITP or thrombocytopenia due to an anti- phospholipid antibody syndrome. A proliferative disorder is possible but considered much less likely given the very long natural history.

Await completion of the following studies: Cryoglobulin, FANA, ANCA, CRP, cardiolipin antibody, C3, C4, serum protein electrophoresis, and rheumatoid factor. Once these studies have been completed, would then consider referring patient to a geneticist at the University of Minnesota for further evaluation."
2319,BM,bowel movement,After that she should go on more aggressive stool softeners to maintain a daily bowel movement. We can discontinue the Foley catheter once she has had a decent BM and assess her at that time. I have asked the nursing staff to call me if her postvoid bladder scans still show residual urines at or above 300 mL.
813,T2,tumor stage 2,"4. MRI of the pelvis showed rectal tumor which was 1.6 x 2.7 cm in size and a 1.6-cm lymph node. She was stage T2 N1 rectal cancer. 5.

3116,C3,(complement) component 3,"I suspect he has underlying renal artery stenosis, but I would not expect it to progress this fast. He also has no flank pain or other complaints for infarction. The plan will be to check ASO, anti-DNase B, C3, C4, FANA, ANCA, and anti-GBM antibody. We will consult Renal for further evaluation and possible kidney biopsy. 2. Hypertension: We have obviously held his lisinopril. Currently, he has been started on clonidine and should probably add in calcium channel blockers, such as amlodipine to that and discontinue his atenolol, as he has developed first-degree AV block and some bradycardia with the very high dose of atenolol for his renal insufficiency."
3648,IT,intertrochanteric,"PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, she is comfortable. The left lower extremity is externally rotated and shortened. Neurologically, she is intact. IMAGING: X-rays show a left IT fracture. IMPRESSION/PLAN: We will go ahead with ORIF. Risks and benefits are discussed."

X-rays: Three views of the hand demonstrate bony defect created by the saw in the middle phalanx and DIP joint."
545,C&S,protein C and protein S,"Interestingly, her baseline APTT is normal. She was started on 75 mg of Lovenox subq q.12h and was started on Coumadin per protocol. A homocysteine level, anticardiolipin, Factor V Leiden and lupus inhibitor was obtained. Protein C&S was not able because she was already given a dose of Lovenox. She remained otherwise hemodynamically stable and on the day prior to discharge was ambulatory in the hallways with little dyspnea or chest pain."
738,CTA,computed tomographic angiography,"Typically, this chest pain will respond to nitroglycerin. The patient was seen at an outside hospital first where she was ruled out for pulmonary embolism by means of CTA.

1449,OR,operating room,"Ulnar nerve neuropraxic injuries were also discussed. Unless there is a need to open the fracture for alignment, the nerve would not be explored, and we will allow the presumed stretch injury to resolve with time. Other risks and benefits were reviewed. The patient's family understands, and we will proceed to the OR when available."
3582,MR,mitral regurgitation,"I have told her she may well get stenting or bypass surgery as needed or as directed by our best judgment from a cardiology standpoint in view of her MR and her diminished LV function.
