2513,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"On _%#MMDD2006#%_, we performed an MR angiogram, which really did not show any difference. Still some wall thickening of the distal small bowel with no evidence of obstruction of the SMA or IMA vessels.

Both procedures allow for direct fetal chromosomal analysis with 99% accuracy. CVS is offered at 11-13 weeks' gestation and amniocentesis is offered after 15 weeks' gestation. Due to their invasive nature, CVS is associated with a 1:200 (0.5%) to 1:100 (1.0%) risk of miscarriage and amniocentesis is nationally associated with a 1:200 (0.5%) risk of miscarriage."

1777,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"She reported no smoking, alcohol use or medications during her pregnancy aside from prenatal vitamins. She had an amniocentesis with her previous pregnancy and desired earlier screening, which would be CVS, which was planned today with Dr. _%#NAME#%_.

HOSPITAL COURSE: He was seen by Neurology who recommended aspirin."
1080,MSSA,methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus,"Considering her recent MSSA infection, I think it is appropriate to treat her slightly more broadly. We will give her Zosyn and Levofloxin to cover her MSSA and community-acquired pneumonia. We will await the results of the blood cultures as well as obtain sputum culture. PROBLEM #2: Recent pulmonary embolism. We will recheck the patient's INR."
2696,FISH,fluorescent in situ hybridization,The biopsy on _%#MMDD#%_ revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma grade 2. The tumor was estrogen and progesterone receptor positive and was negative for HER-2 by FISH analysis. There was also an ultrasound-guided biopsy of a left axillary enlarged and this revealed replacement by tumor cells. The pathologist was not able to determine whether this represented within the tail of the breast or in a residual lymph node.
472,MP,mercaptopurine,"The patient tolerated his initial chemotherapy quite well and also received prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate. Prior to discharge he was continuing to tolerate chemotherapy well and the plan was to discharge him and have him continue the chemotherapy with oral 6-mercaptopurine (MP), cytarabine and Cytoxan as an outpatient.

She was hospitalized at Fairview University Hospital just a little over one week ago for abdominal swelling and variceal bleeding. She had banding at the time. SBP was also found. She was started on IV antibiotics. She has been at the _%#CITY#%_ Health Center receiving IV antibiotics since then."
3575,MR,magnetic resonance,"He is admitted after recent laboratory studies were obtained in the clinic after he presented with symptoms of a two week history of left hip pain. Apparently a plane film was negative and further MR scan may have been done on an outpatient basis, results of which we are not clear on. In the meantime, he had blood work done at the clinic and was told to come for hospitalization because of a potassium of about 6 and an elevated creatinine."
1057,MSSA,modified selective severity assessment,PLAN: 1. The patient will return to see his primary care physician for follow up of TSH level and thyroid adjustment if necessary. 2. Encourage the patient to see an optometrist for evaluation of eye correction. 3. Continue MSSA protocol. I anticipate blood pressure normalization with resolution of mild alcohol withdrawal syndrome. 4. Patient to have recheck of LFTs in approximately two weeks to confirm normalization.
1174,PA,physician assistant,"Otherwise, her central nervous system exam seemed intact, though the lateral antibrachial cutaneous nerve had some dysthesia, as well.

Subsequently she went back into sinus rhythm as noted above. Her PR interval was normal. QRS is normal. This is a complex combination of events. I believe this woman has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, likely sick sinus syndrome and a tendency both to tachycardia and bradycardia."
3655,ER,emergency room,"MUSCULOSKELETAL: The patient states he has chronic left-sided weakness. It is unclear if this is related to his CVI in 1999 or possibly due to arthritis as he complains of chronic left hip pain. Chest x-ray reveals hyperinflated lungs. No acute infiltrate. Hip and pelvic x-rays per ER report reveal right superior pubic ramus fracture. LABORATORY DATA: INR 0.96, white count 11.8, hemoglobin 14.7, platelets 272,000."

Secondary to constipation (no BM for the past four days), she stopped taking her narcotics and switched to Tylenol yesterday noon. Her last dose of Tylenol was last night. This morning she woke up with increased pain and secondary to not having a bowel movement, she presented herself to the emergency room for further evaluation."
