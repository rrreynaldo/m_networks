2513,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"On _%#MMDD2006#%_, we performed an MR angiogram, which really did not show any difference. Still some wall thickening of the distal small bowel with no evidence of obstruction of the SMA or IMA vessels.

Both procedures allow for direct fetal chromosomal analysis with 99% accuracy. CVS is offered at 11-13 weeks' gestation and amniocentesis is offered after 15 weeks' gestation. Due to their invasive nature, CVS is associated with a 1:200 (0.5%) to 1:100 (1.0%) risk of miscarriage and amniocentesis is nationally associated with a 1:200 (0.5%) risk of miscarriage."

803,T2,T2 (MRI),"Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the care and evaluation of this very interesting, pleasant gentleman. ADDENDUM: I have just received a preliminary report on the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. There was a nonspecific T2 signal described on the right side of the cervical spine at the C3-C4 level. The possibility of a demyelinating disorder was raised. Interestingly, the thoracic cord did not reveal any abnormalities as identified by the preliminary report."
842,T2,T2 (MRI),"5. History of hypercalcemia. 6. Chronic malnutrition. PROCEDURES: 1. CT of the head (_%#MMDD2005#%_): Interpretation limited by significant motion artifact. No interval change. 2. MRI of the brain with and without contrast (_%#MMDD2005#%_): This study demonstrated greater than 10 foci of T2 hyperintensity within the cerebral white matter, consistent with a clinical suspicion of demyelinating _________ disease. Post contrast images are degraded by significant motion artifact. There is progression of disease as compared with a prior study."

PROBLEM #4: Seizure disorder. The patient was continued on his divalproex EC 750 mg t.i.d. It is unclear what the patient's initial presentation was in terms of his seizure disorder. He states that his last seizure was in 1986. Given his profound cytopenia, consideration may be given to a trial of medications or at least a review of the events leading up to his original placement on antiseizure medications."
2102,AVR,augmented voltage right arm,"The issue is ischemia causing rapid ventricular rate from atrial fibrillation which further causes ischemia or is this atrial fibrillation which is causing demand ischemia. Review of his electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation and some elevation in AVR so of course there is concern that there is left main disease.

2377,ET,enterostomal therapy,"Her incision was healing nicely. She had minimal output from her Jackson-Pratt drain, so this was removed. She was comfortable with care of her colostomy, so she was discharged home. Follow-up care will be with the ET nurse, her primary care physician, and Dr. _%#NAME#%_."
