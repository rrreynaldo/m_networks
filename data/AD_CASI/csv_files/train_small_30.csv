20867,CVA,cerebrovascular accident,The significance of the history that the patient has not been taking his medications reliably for the last few days is not clear. I certainly doubt that the syncopal episode represented either a primary neurologic event such as a CVA or seizure or a primary cardiac event. The patient currently feels quite well and feels ready to be discharged back to the Lodging Plus unit.

In addition, there was a large right ventricular apex mass consistent with a thrombus. This is a small posterior pericardiac effusion of uncertain significance."
9786,PDA,patent ductus arteriosus,"Her last chest x-ray on _%#DDMM2007#%_ showed borderline cardiomegaly, but was otherwise normal. Problem #3: Cardiovascular. Because of a murmur that was heard intermittently, _%#NAME#%_ had an echocardiogram on _%#DDMM2007#%_ which revealed a small PDA with minimal left to right shunting, a small patent foramen ovale with minimal shunting, and multiple small mid-muscular and apical-muscular defects in the ventricular septum."

He will be discharged home later today and follow-up with _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, NP in approximately two weeks as well as a follow-up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in approximately three months. If he has any problems in the interim, I would certainly be happy to see him sooner."
21940,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Many of the symptoms might be accounted for with this diagnosis, although there are obviously other explanations as well. He could have low platelet counts due to ITP, but that would not fit with his recent onset fever and rigors. 2. Anemia, which is likely multifactorial, including blood loss. His reticulocyte count, however, is inappropriately low, however, may suggest other causes including anemia due to impaired iron mobilization, such as with chronic inflammation or even a primary bone marrow disorder."

22085,AV,atrioventricular,"There seems to be something particular about these child that predisposes them top complete AV block, as even children without surgery but who have Down syndrome seem to be at increased risk of heart block. At this point, I cannot predict whether _%#NAME#%_ will progress to complete AV block, but he does seem to fit 2 criteria for pacemaker implantation. I would recommend that he have a single chamber epicardial ventricular pacemaker placed, at a time that suits the otolaryngologist, because he will need to be re-intubated."

He has a recent right BK amputation. He was able to move his left leg fairly well and lift it from the bed slightly and wiggle his toes.
9405,PA,pulmonary artery,"In the meantime, he should continue on all his current medications. I will obtain an echocardiogram for further assessment of his biventricular function as well as PA pressures. Further recommendations may follow."
1023,IVF,intravenous fluid,"He is also on amiodarone and could be some concern for toxicity given his slight bumps in his LFTs as well as prolonged QT. Will recheck EKG in the a.m. Based on most recent documented EF of 50%, will administer IVF cautiously and follow pulmonary sx/exam closely for signs of pulmonary edema. PROBLEM # 5: Right-sided pleural effusion c/w exudate. Cirrhosis versus pancreatic CA vs. lung cancer are possible etiologies."
20044,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"The mesentery feeding this area was very foreshortened. The mass at the base of the mesentery was large and quite a bit larger than it seemed on CT scan for some reason. I felt it was worth trying to see if we could dissect down into this region to better understand its relationship to the SMA just to be sure that this wasn't potentially resectable. With that in mind, we identified the middle colic vessels and then stayed just to the left of that vessel."

24577,ASA,acetylsalicylic acid,"There was concern that perhaps the patient's epigastric discomfort may have been related to her Pentasa, which she had taken one dose of prior to admission. There was some question during the patient's past episode of pancreatitis that perhaps Asacol had been related to this, so perhaps the patient has some side effects from five ASA compounds? In regards to the patient's mild lipase elevation, this decreased to approximately 250 by the day of discharge."
27442,AC,adriamycin cyclophosphamide,She had a 1.3. and 1.2 cm sized primary lesion with a DCIS and one of two axillary nodes positive. The sentinel node with extracapsular extension.

However, on exam and by history he had no localizing infectious symptoms other than his recent diagnosis of possible SBP. Infectious Disease was consulted to see whether this was contaminant or representing true pathogenic bacteremia. They felt this was likely contaminant because enterococcus can be a contaminant and there is two different species also consistent with a contaminant."

I do not see any skin rash. We will obtain urine to rule out UTI."
10579,GT,gastrostomy tube,"Then 0.1 mg GT q. 8 hours from _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_ to _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_. Then decrease to 0.1 mg GT b.i.d. from _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_ to _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_. He should be off (?Activin) on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2002. 12. Metamucil 36 mg, which is 0.4 cc GT q.d."
26322,IR,interventional radiology,"Radiology was consulted regarding placement of PNT; however, they were unsuccessful in doing so. Therefore, the patient underwent a CT guided PNT placement by IR Radiology. The patient underwent reimplantation of the transplanted ureter on _%#MMDD2004#%_. The patient's hemodialysis was discontinued around _%#MMDD2004#%_. This was secondary to increasing urine output and incremental drop in the patient's creatinine and BUN."

Respiratory: An ABG and CXR were obtained on admission due to _%#NAME#%_'s respiratory status and found to be normal. _%#NAME#%_ was placed on supplemental O2 and was weaned quickly to RA. She was able to maintain adequate oxygenation on RA. It is likely that the initial respiratory distress was due to delayed intrauterine transition. She had no respiratory distress with feedings. 3. ID: A sepsis evaluation was done on admission.
9618,PDA,patent ductus arteriosus,"The proximal LAD stent was open. The second obtuse marginal branch had a subtotal occlusion that was evident on the _%#DDMM2002#%_ exam.

22705,IB,international baccalaureate,"As a result, she is concerned about her interaction with her family. This patient is currently in the 11th grade at Patrick Henry High School. She is in the IB program and finds it to be challenging. Right now she tends to get A's and B's and believes that her ranking is somewhere in the top 5-10% of her class."
24864,C3,cervical (level) 3,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 57-year-old female who presented on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2002 with decreased mentation and neck pain, noted to have an epidural abscess which was drained at Fairview Southdale Hospital by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_. She underwent a laminectomy from C3 through T2. The patient is intubated and unresponsive and on IV antibiotics. She has cultured positive for Strep.

If the patient needs an agent in this class of medications, TZD agents, will switch him to Actos For now, though we will hold the medication"
16188,NP,nurse practitioner,"She is presenting with first episode of hemetemesis. The patient was seen in GI Clinic by _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, NP yesterday. She was complaining of her first episode of vomiting out some blood clots. At the time it was decided that the patient should have an outpatient upper endoscopy for further evaluation."
18615,BM,bowel movement,"Scan for 116 to 387 cc yesterday. Had incontinent episode, continue ICP and teaching. May want a condom catheter at night. GASTROINTESTINAL: Last BM was on _%#MMDD2005#%_. SKIN: Clear. PSYCHOLOGIC: He answers short questions, is sleepy. NEUROLOGIC: Increased tone, 3-/4, on an Ashworth scale."
9849,PDA,posterior descending artery,"As noted above, this showed that his saphenous venous graft placed in 2001 to the OM was now occluded. However, the LIMA to the LAD and remaining saphenous venous graft to the right PDA were patent. An attempt was made to perform PCI in the native OM1 which was partially successful with balloon angioplasty."
26194,IR,interventional radiology,The patient's pain likely had a behavioral component to it as he did have anxiety over his line removal and replacement done in IR. At this time there is not a concrete diagnosis for his abdominal pain and vomiting. PROBLEM # 6: Hematology. The patient's anemia was treated with Epogen given during his dialysis runs.

14186,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"Therefore, a maternal serum alpha fetoprotein is recommended at 16 weeks gestation. ? I explained that some couples prefer the definitive information provided by amniocentesis or CVS. Other couples may be uncomfortable with the risk of miscarriage and are sufficiently reassured by screening options. I emphasized that prenatal testing decisions are personal decisions and each couple must make the choice that is right for them."
3184,DC,direct current,"The patient was not loaded, rather will have low-dose amiodarone. I anticipate DC cardioversion in approximately one month. He will have Cardiology visit in three to four weeks and DC cardioversion arranged thereafter."
24268,CA,cancer,"However, elevated liver tests were found as well as a lipase of greater than 40,000. The patient denies any new meds. She is treated for hypertension, depression, and has had breast CA. She denies any alcohol intake. In addition, the patient was told she is anemia on this admission."
24689,ASA,American Society of Anesthesiologists,"Recent creatinine was normal. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, really no significant ST-T wave changes. ASSESSMENT: A 54-year-old gentleman here for preoperative exam with total hip replacement planned. He would be an ASA II for surgery. Right now, his diabetes seems to be under decent control with a hemoglobin A1C 8.4 two months ago but better improvement since then."
2949,DC,discontinue,"At this point I have recommended some changes in his medications to try to better limit his exposure to these issues. I am going to ask for neuro checks every shift. We will DC his Dilaudid, Percocet and Valium and start him on OxyContin 10 mg b.i.d. with Vicodin prn for break-through pain and Vistaril as ordered."
14911,EC,enteric-coated,The results of this will need to be followed up by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in Cardiology Clinic in one month's time. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Bonola (??) 10 mg p.o. q.d. 2.

28393,T4,thyroxine,"Now with the transplant, it should be correcting soon. Her albumin level is low normal and hopefully with replacing albumin cc for cc, per transplant orders, this should correct soon. 4. Hypothyroidism. The patient is on Synthroid, and TSH and T4 were fine on _%#MMDD2003#%_. 5. Steroid-induced diabetes: She is on prednisone taper, which should help. Also we will check Accu-Chek and cover with sliding-scale insulin p.r.n."
11654,BMP,basic metabolic profile,"Consequently, the patient will go home with this drain in place after Dr. _%#NAME#%_ did review today. LABORATORY DATA: There is a BMP, hemoglobin, and zinc level pending from this morning on _%#MMDD2004#%_. On _%#MMDD2004#%_ hemoglobin A1c 5.7. Phosphorus 4.2. Magnesium 2.1. BMP within normal limits at that point with a glucose noted to 158, and calcium 7.5. On _%#MMDD2004#%_ hemoglobin 9.9. On _%#MMDD2004#%_ transferrin 145 and albumin 2.5."
29471,ER,emergency room,"Patient's wife, _%#NAME#%_, is followed by me. Information obtained entirely from wife, office record and the case was discussed with the ER physician.

1610,SS,single strength,"It showed heavy growth of two strains of Methicillin-resistant staph aureus. Therefore, his discharge plan will be the same except for an addition of Bactrim SS, 1 tab p.o. b.i.d. x7 days. I did discuss the fact that the patient lists an allergy to sulfa with a reaction of depression."
11526,OR,operating room,"HOSPITAL COURSE: This patient was referred to Dr. _%#NAME#%_ at the University of Minnesota for repair of the above. On _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, he was taken to the OR and the procedure was performed without complication. Postoperatively, he came to the intensive care unit where he was admitted for cardiopulmonary monitoring and resuscitation."
20537,PD,peritoneal dialysis,"Increase in creatinine and BUN with poor urine output despite the Bumex drip. Continued oxygen need and electrolyte abnormalities. He was transferred to the pediatric ICU following PD catheter placement on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006, for initiation PD. He was transferred back to 5A on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006.

24377,CA,carbohydrate antigen,"This was ER positive and weekly progesterone receptor positive, was negative for HER2 by FISH analysis. The patient had some laboratory studies on _%#MMDD2007#%_ with a CBC, which was unremarkable; however, her CA 2729 tumor marker came back markedly elevated at 654. I believe this was an unanticipated finding. On _%#MMDD2007#%_, probably as a result of bilateral breast cancer and the markedly elevated CA 2729, Dr. _%#NAME#%_ ordered a PET CT scan."
11794,BMP,basic metabolic profile,"Vent is set at SMIV 850/8/5/5 40% FiO2. LABORATORY: Significant for a hemoglobin of 9.4, previously 11.2. An INR of 2.18. BMP had a BUN of 77 and a creatinine of 1.46. Remainder of the BMP was normal. AVG was 7.25/38/26/16. HOSPITAL COURSE: PROBLEM #1: Urology. The patient came in with gross hematuria that was controlled after cystoscopy was cauterized."
20275,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,There is also a mild wall thickening of the cecum with known pericecal inflammatory changes. IMPRESSION: I think we can unify the clinical presentation is being caused spine some type of proximal thrombosis with emboli of the SMA and renal arteries and the cecal inflammation is probably therefore due to ischemia rather than IBD. The patient does have a remote history of breast cancer and that would raise concern about recurrence.
27519,AC,(drug) AC,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Zithromax 250 mg one daily for one day only. 2. Lasix 40 mg one p.o. in the morning and 20 mg at bedtime. 3. Robitussin AC 5 to 10 ml p.o. q 6h p.r.n. for cough. 4. Synthroid 100 mcg one daily. 5. Lopressor 50 mg one p.o. b.i.d.

15279,PE,pulmonary embolus,LABORATORY DATA: A D-dimer assay was performed and was slightly elevated at 0.8 (normal up to 0.5). IMPRESSION: Questionable right upper lobe filling defect seen on CT with PE protocol. At present this is being empirically treated as if it were a PE. It does not explain her chest wall discomfort and she has no hemoptysis or hypoxemia. Excluding a pulmonary embolism is important to make a decision about long-term anticoagulation.
24873,C3,propionylcarnitine,"In addition, she is to follow up with the primary physicians, if she has any concerns regarding the patient's development, growth, and management. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: _%#NAME#%_ is a 6-day-old term new born female who was discovered on the Minnesota new born screen to have an elevated C3 acylcarnitine level of 10.85 with a normal level being less than 5.25.

23281,ES,extra strength,"Throughout this time TPN was weaned from postoperative day #7 through postoperative day #9. On postoperative day #9 patient was switched to oral antibiotics, Augmentin ES 100. This formulation was chosen to help decrease diarrhea. At this point, patient's GI function had completely stabilized, was taking breast milk without any emesis."
11323,OR,operating room,"He also had mild abdominal pain. He also had some hypertensive episodes, and Norvasc was started. He continued to improve until _%#DDMM2002#%_ when he developed severe abdominal pain. He was taken back to the OR and had primary repair of small bowel perforation.

At that time a nuclear stress test was performed and showed atrial scarring versus thinning. No further evaluation for cardiac ischemia was made. Because of the patient's pneumonia at that time she was treated for her COPD and pneumonia and no further evaluation or treatment for her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was made."
18115,AMA,against medical advice,"The patient was in the ICU until _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2003, when the patient left AMA.

1510,SA,sinuatrial,"This also could be related to just his respiratory arrest that could have been from a cardiac cause, as he does have a history of underlying tachycardia. At this time, he has no evidence, by his EKG or rhythm strips, of any sort of AV nodal or SA nodal dysfunction, or evidence for any reentrant tachycardia. There is no other prolongation of the QT. However, given his respiratory arrest, the likelihood of this either relating to his acute lung injury versus a specific cardiac issue, is one that needs to be delineated."

The patient had his first treatment from _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2002 through _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2002 without complication. The patient does not describe any positive review of systems, except for a ""chest cold"" x 1 week; however, he felt that this was improving."
27292,AC,acromioclavicular,"She had significant worsening pain and redness, however, and was seen by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in consultation.

6400,T2,T2 (MRI),"Neurology was consulted and an MRI was obtained which showed mild diffuse dural thickening and contrast enhancement maybe secondary to intracranial hypertension; however, an infectious or inflammatory process is not excluded. Markedly abnormal T2 signal hyperintensity within the posterior internal capsule, consistent with a demyelination process. The etiology is uncertain. An MRI of the cervical spine showed abnormal signal intensity in the cervical spinal cord from C2 through the top of C7 with a differential diagnosis including infectious disease, vascular ischemia, degenerative syndrome, or inflammatory or toxic or metabolic process."
25685,PAC,premature atrial contraction,"She has no seizure history, no brain trauma. Dr. _%#NAME#%_ of Neurology requested that Cardiology also be consulted to rule out a possible cardiac etiology. The patient did have an electrocardiogram performed on admission which was notable for some bradycardia and perhaps PAC versus a wondering atrial pacemaker, but otherwise was negative. She had several troponins that were negative. She had an echocardiogram that was essentially normal."
28407,MR,magnetic resonance,"From neurological standpoint as far as the management of her stroke, she needs to be on heparin or Lovenox at this point and then she needs to be on Coumadin for at least three months after the event and then if no other cardiac embolic risk factors are found, she could be on Plavix. Again, at this point I have discussed with patient and her son that I would like to proceed with MRI of the brain with MR angiogram and after that have a discussion with Cardiology as far as safety of cardiac procedure. Dr. _%#NAME#%_, my colleague, will be rounding tomorrow and will most likely participate in that discussion."

Probably will continue to treat with Silvadene at this point.
21910,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"IMPRESSION: 1. Apparently acute onset of severe thrombocytopenia with essentially cutaneous only bleeding. The severity of the thrombocytopenia makes it most likely that this is immune-mediated, and ITP would be the most likely explanation, either idiopathic or related to a possible viral or medication exposure. She has no evidence of a systemic illness, such as lupus, although this would be difficult to completely exclude."
22892,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"She has continued to be febrile and continues to have abdominal pain, diarrhea, and no clear source of the infection has been identified as of yet and processed. There was some concern for lymphoma or reoccurrence of a past MAI. BAL biopsy, flow cytometry, BAL cytopathology, and peripheral blood smear have all been taken. There have been no clear leads at this point. She has received treatment with imipenem, Mycobutin, dapsone, and fluconazole, azithromycin, and levofloxacin, as well as her regular HIV medications for treatment of the infectious disease processes."

IMPRESSION: 84-year-old female with probable pancreatic carcinoma with liver metastases.
17192,AVR,aortic valve replacement,"Nevertheless, the patient continues to accuse the surgeons of using him as a guinea pig, and that the surgery was not necessary. Given his high gradient he would be considered for a repeat AVR, and this was also discussed with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ of CV staff here. At any rate, medical records from the West Side Clinic were obtained, and they did state that the patient had been on Coumadin at 10 mg p.o. q.d. on three days of the week, and 8.5 mg p.o. q.d. on other days."

3102,DC,direct current,"I will add Coumadin as I think he should have anticoagulation given his risk factors for thromboembolism of hypertension and left atrial enlargement. 3. Consider DC cardioversion in approximately one month or if this needs to be done sooner, do a TEE next week and if no LA thrombus, do cardioversion at that time."
18054,AMA,against medical advice,"He was trying to get off of a methadone maintenance program, and weaned himself down to 30 or 40 mg. He came in here to detox off of the last part of the methadone maintenance, but when this withdrawal became too painful, he left AMA. He did this twice.

18980,ET,endotracheal,"He has a severe anoxic encephalopathy. I do not know how long he was out in the field with intermittent perfusing rhythm but it took us in the emergency room at least 20 minutes with CPR to return a perfusing rhythm which is either sinus rhythm, sinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, it is very hard to see on the monitor. I think the differential includes pulmonary embolism, not likely, but he did complain about shoulder pain, his RV is somewhat generous but decreased RV function and he also has blood coming out of the ET tube, although that certainly could have been secondary to CPR and the intubation rather than a pulmonary infarction or hemorrhage."

The parents were asked to make an appointment for their child to see you on _%#MMDD2002#%_. Home Care nurse will visit on _%#MMDD2002#%_ and assess the need for future visits.
14244,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"She stated that this information would be helpful to her and _%#NAME#%_, as it would allow them to prepare for the birth of a child with a chromosome abnormality. _%#NAME#%_ decided to do first trimester screening today, but wants to discuss the option of CVS and amniocentesis with you at her next OB visit. I assured her that while there is a miscarriage risk associated with both procedures, our perinatologists have performed both procedures numerous times."
23913,FSH,follicle-stimulating hormone,"Hemoglobin is reduced at 9.9 but is stable. The patient reports that she has not had a period now for three years, although I see that she is on Provera. We did draw an FSH and this was 5.2 which is in the normal range, 2.5 to 10.2, so it seems to be unlikely that she is in menopause."

He was seen and went to the OR for wash out. He will likely require another surgery in the next several days. Postoperatively, I am seeing him and he seemed okay. He has a little bit of cough."
315,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"He was found to have metastatic disease now involving his spine as well as liver, abdomen and brain. The weakness was felt to be related to the cervical and thoracic metastases with spinal cord compression, with fractures at T1 through T4, also severe canal stenosis into the cervical spine. He had been treated with high dose steroids and his weakness is likely secondary to steroid myopathy with acute myelopathic changes as well."
20073,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"She was given alprazolam and BuSpar. PROBLEM #4: Hyperglycemia. The patient's glucose was 240 when she came in. Her initial urinalysis showed negative glucose. Her repeat SMA then showed a glucose level of 214.

She also showed signs of some iron deficiency suggesting that perhaps her ITP is not th e total explanation for why she has heme-positive stools, but in any event she is not in a situation where aggressive investigation can be done endoscopically because of her low platelet count."
188,T1,tumor stage 1,"Gait is not evaluated. LABORATORY DATA: The pathology report is as already stated. A CBC from _%#MMDD2005#%_ shows a white count of 6000, hemoglobin 15.0, platelet count 282,000, INR 0.98, potassium 4.1. IMPRESSION: The patient has recent findings of a T1 N2 M0 stage III a nonsmall cell lung carcinoma arising the right upper lobe. She appears to have tolerated the surgery well, and given her generally good health, I think she could potentially benefit from adjuvant therapy."
19977,CVP,central venous pressure,"No family with the patient. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Now is suggestive of a blood pressure of 90-100 systolic by 68 diastolic.

2830,DC,direct current,"She has been chronically anticoagulated with Coumadin. Since she has had relatively few episodes of atrial fibrillation, she is asymptomatic now, I would favor rate control over an antiarrhythmic drug at this time. If she remains in atrial fibrillation, I would consider DC cardioversion but would maintain only the dose of atenolol. Since she has been chronically anticoagulated she would most likely not require DC cardioversion, we would request her previous INRs over the last 3 weeks and if her INRS have been therapeutic we could proceed with DC cardioversion tomorrow if she is still in atrial fibrillation."

There was increased T2 signaling on the ultrasound. There were no findings to suggest this mass was an uterine or broad ligament sarcoma. There was a small amount of fluid in the cul-de-sac and moderate diffuse sigmoid diverticulosis."
14314,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,The absence of any such markers can provide reassurance. Level II ultrasound cannot definitively diagnose or exclude the presence of any chromosome condition. * I explained that some couples prefer the definitive information provided by amniocentesis or CVS. Other couples may be uncomfortable with the risk of miscarriage and are sufficiently reassured by screening options. I emphasized that prenatal testing decisions are personal decisions and each couple must make the choice that is right for them.

17697,PR,pr interval,"His ventricular rate slowed down to approximately 50. I can now probably map out P-waves at roughly 100 with a 2:1 block. Since the initial EKG actually had a ventricular rate of 97, I suspect what the original rhythm was sinus tachycardia with a very short PR interval, since again after the pause I am because able to map out P-waves at a rate of 100. The interesting thing though is the P to QRS interval is changing so this may actually be iso-rhythmic accelerated junctional tachycardia which is what I think we are seeing with the intermittent capture from the SA node."

I also discussed with her that exploratory laparotomy and debulking surgery may be considered as an up front option."
1329,SA,sinuatrial,"As far as bradycardia is concerned, this is a known complication of inferior wall MI. This could be related to ischemia of the SA versus AV node or it could also be the neurocardiac reflex resulting in bradycardia. At present, the patient's heart rate is in 40s however his blood pressure is stable and he is tolerating that well."

26232,IR,interventional radiology,"She was seen by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ from General Surgery who recommended continuing the JP drain but replacing it under IR prior to considering surgery. Family apparently has been fairly resistant to undergoing surgery. In any case, the JP drain was supposed to be replaced today by IR, but inadvertently the 2 JP drains that were present were removed but they were not replaced. As such, the patient now needs to have a new JP drain placed and also given the circumstances of her being on an Adult Medicine Service at this time and being in need of more advanced care, Dr. _%#NAME#%_ felt it would be wise for the patient to be transferred to a facility where she could get more specialized care, and we also feel it is important for her to get Pediatric care given her young age."

19669,CVP,central venous pressure,"Cardiology consultation was obtained while she was in the surgical intensive care unit, and they felt, again, the patient's hypotension and bradycardia due to anesthesia induction was of non-cardiac etiology and was most likely related only to the induction that she received. They noted recent normal echocardiogram with a normal CVP of 7 while the patient was in the surgical intensive unit. Therefore, they thought it was unlikely to show any new changes by repeating an echocardiogram at this time."
28554,MR,magnetic resonance,"A bit of visual blurring had occurred during part of the illness. The patient due to the spinal tap findings and headache history underwent MRI scan and MR angiogram of the intracranial vessels. There was no aneurysm evident. The vessels were widely patent.

14045,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,Markers are seen in approximately 50-60% of babies with Down syndrome and approximately 80-90% of babies with the more severe trisomies 13 and 18. Both the chorionic villi sampling (CVS) procedure and the amniocentesis procedure were discussed as the only means of definitively diagnosing a numerical chromosome abnormality in a pregnancy.
22907,BAL,blood alcohol level,"He says that he started drinking about 72 hours ago. He had an excessive amount of alcohol last night and his girlfriend called 911 and he was brought to the emergency room with a BAL of 0.46. He was placed on a 72-hour hold and is now admitted here.

She speaks English very well. She will be a sophomore this year and describes no learning disabilities. She is in ELL Programming. PHYSICAL STATUS: See internist note for details.
14143,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,Risk of miscarriage is approximately 1:200. We reviewed the rare possibility of ambiguous results of slow growth and the possibility of needing a follow up amniocentesis. CVS does not test for all birth defects as we all face a 3 to 4 percent risk to have a baby with a birth defect.

RCA has moderate diffuse disease including a 50 to 60% AV groove segment. The LIMA to LAD is wildly patent. The radial graft to the RPDA is patent with mild distal disease in the RPDA."
19550,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"Her last CT scan and visit with me was in _%#MM2006#%_, which showed further progression of the retroperitoneal adenopathy, however, the patient was clinically stable and doing well. Labs at that time showed a hemoglobin of 11.1 with normal indices. Her CEA was 0.6. Her LDH was normal at 500. She did have an elevated sed rate of 92 and the beta 2 microglobulin was up to 6.3. This was interpreted by myself as showing slowly progressing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but we felt we could still continue to follow her especially since she wanted to remain living independently."
25457,PT,physical therapy,DISPOSITION: Expect a 5-7 day hospitalization stay as we try to stabilize the patient with new onset congestive heart failure and new lung mass. We will get PT and OT involved as well as social services for possible placement into Rehab or nursing home.
18270,AMA,against medical advice,"Medical therapy was tried, but he continued to have ongoing chest pain and therefore he was scheduled for an angiogram on _%#MMDD#%_ with me. The lab was running late and he refused to stay and walked out AMA, never called our office back and never scheduled another heart catheterization. Reviewing the chart, apparently there has been some other issues about stressors in his life and noncompliance and, in fact, the internist tells me even on this admission he was starting to make some ""early waves""."
16289,NP,nurse practitioner,"We did have the opportunity today to review _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_'s clinical history as well as imaging studies. My colleague, _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, NP, carried out the consultation note and I have no addition to her outstanding assessment. I met with the patient and his family.

14008,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"Screening tests, such as first trimester screen, provide risk assessments for specific conditions, but cannot definitively diagnose or exclude these conditions. Diagnostic tests, such as CVS and amniocentesis can definitively diagnose or exclude the presence of certain chromosome conditions, but are associated with a small risk of miscarriage."
10351,BK,BK (virus),"During this hospitalization, it was noted that on his previous admission, the BK virus PCR from urine on _%#MMDD2004#%_ came back positive. A repeat BK PCR was sent on _%#MMDD2004#%_ and results are pending at this time. Mr. _%#NAME#%_ tolerated the biopsy procedure well.

13090,MS,multiple sclerosis,As she has been seen in that system before I would recommend acute rehab at Sister Kenney Institute. Her new weaknesses are not due to exacerbation of MS she probably will be able to recondition and return to her baseline. She has identified a need for adaptive equipment. She probably could benefit from having a more intensive rehabilitation evaluation to allow her to return to independent living more safely.

He will follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ at the end of this course. 2. Wheezing. He was wheezing a bit. Therefore, RT did show him how to an albuterol MDI. He was given a prescription for this as well. Likely with resolution of his infection, the wheezing wall resolved."
14189,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,Patients who elect to forgo modified sequential screening should still be offered maternal serum AFP screening for spina bifida in the second trimester. * I explained that some couples prefer the definitive information provided by amniocentesis or CVS. Other couples may be uncomfortable with the risk of miscarriage and are sufficiently reassured by screening options. I emphasized that prenatal testing decisions are personal decisions and each couple must make the choice that is right for them.
14579,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"d. There is some evidence of a possible GI bleed with his 2 gram hemoglobin drop in two weeks. The patient does not look at his stools, and they could be dark. e. SBP is unlikely since there is no ascites. f.

22352,AV,atrioventricular,"After being given diltiazem in the Emergency Department, he converted back to sinus rhythm, with a rate of 40's-50's. He most likely has an underlying AV node dysfunction with his bradycardia at rest, and his inappropriate response to atrial fibrillation. He will continue to be monitored, and at this time, will be treated solely with aspirin."
