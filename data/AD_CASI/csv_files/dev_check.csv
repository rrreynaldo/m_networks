PROCEDURES: On _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005: Right exploratory thoracotomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection."
1,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"Echocardiogram was negative. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Acute infarction in the middle carotid area, leading to left facial drooping and mild weakness of the left arm and left leg barely detectable. 2. Herpes zoster in the right T1 to T4 area, including the arm and mid- back. 3. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled. 4. Obesity."
2,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Left upper extremity weakness and numbness superimposed on T1 distribution, left upper extremity pain. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Notable for rheumatoid arthritis, tobacco abuse and alcohol use."
3,T1,thoracic (level) 1,A head CT without contrast demonstrated no acute abnormality. Cervical spine films raised a question of soft tissue swelling posteriorly. A CT through the cervical spine from C2 to T1 demonstrated no apparent fracture or subluxation per ER physician. It is noted that the patient underwent a brain MRI with and without contrast earlier today apparently to evaluate a movement disorder.
4,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"He was seen by his family practitioner earlier today who obtained an MRI/MRA at the T2 level what appears to be non-enhancing mass involving the T2, as well as parts of the T1, and T3 vertebra. There is a mass effect upon the thecal sac in a somewhat circumferential fashion. After the scan was performed apparently the family physician by report talked to a Neurosurgeon up in _%#CITY#%_."
5,T1,T1 (MRI),"Left lung remains clear. 6. MRI of the abdomen performed on _%#MMDD2006#%_. Conclusion is a quiet hemachromatosis of the liver and spleen. Possible hepatic cirrhosis with multinodular appearance on noncontrast T1 weighted images that may represent regenerating nodules. Cannot evaluate the liver for advancing nodules, however. If clinically indicated, a contrast enhanced CT could be performed prior to a planned dialysis."
6,T1,T1 (MRI),"This may represent metastases or postinfectious process. An MRI of the right left was done, which showed 4.6 x 4.7 x 7.5 cm high-grade tumor consistent with high grade osteosarcoma.

10,T1,T1 (MRI),"An MRI was then accomplished in the evening of _%#MMDD2006#%_, which showed a mass in the midline anterosuperior cerebellar vermis which was hyperintense on T2 weighted images and hypointense on T1 weighted images, measuring 3.2 x 2.4 x 2.7 cm. There was another focal area of enhancement lateral to this mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere measuring 2.6 x 1 x 0.8 cm, which was not well-identified on the unenhanced images."
11,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"She denies pain with movement. She has no difficulty swallowing or breathing. Previous MRIs in _%#MM#%_ showed a mass at the C2 vertebral body and T1 vertebral body. The MRI was consistent with extensive mets to the skeleton, subcutaneous tissue, and adrenal glands. Since her diagnosis on _%#MMDD#%_, she has been treated with one cycle of Taxol and carboplatin."
12,T1,tumor stage 1,"PROBLEM: Acute myeloid leukemia. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. _%#NAME#%_ is a 68-year-old who has a history of T1 N0 left breast cancer diagnosed in 2000.

We were asked to see the patient postoperatively for general medical care with particular regard to known history of reactive airway disease and obstructive sleep apnea."
18,T1,T1 (MRI),The CT scan of the head revealed a normal exam. The MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine revealed a thin epidural fluid collection that appeared bright on the T1 and T2 sequences. The Neuroradiology fellow thought this was consistent with an epidural hematoma but because of the contrast agent given could not rule out completely an epidural abscess.
19,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"Sensation was present in the left paraspinal area. However, it was absent in the left arm, including the C6,7,8, and T1 dermatomes. The T2 dermatome in the axilla was intact. She had no C-spine discomfort. She had full active range of motion of her C-spine, and had no midline tenderness of her C-spine."
20,T1,T1 (MRI),"He denies any pain or constitutional symptoms. MRI showed a large anterior medial thigh consistent with intramuscular lipoma. There is intense fat on T1 and T2 imaging. It is intermittently associated with femoral vessels, but does not encase these structures. It is likely an intramuscular lipoma. This may be an atypical presentation that has recurred significantly over a relatively short period of time."

26,T1,T1 (MRI),"The patient was again partially controlled up until recently. She decided to ask to have re-imaging of her brain to help with possible control of her seizures. The MRI showed a lesion that was isointense with T1 and hyperintense with T2 weighted imaging. It did not enhance with gadolinium contrast, and she has a swollen hippocampal lobe."
27,T1,T1 (MRI),"He has extensive osteoarthritic changes. The axial images are compromised secondary to motion artifact, although they do demonstrate primarily foraminal rather than central stenosis. His T1 images do not demonstrate significant central stenosis, particularly at the level of his cord atrophy. The area of most stenosis centrally appears to be C3-4."

This was treated in 2002, by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ with a partial glossectomy and ipsilateral modified radical neck dissection."
46,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"Of note: On her cervical CT imaging, there appears to be mass behind more prominently the body of C4 through the superior portion of the body of T1. In order to clarify this, emergent MRI scanning was done, there is certainly a mass from C4 through the superior portion of T1 that has a consistency of that of acute blood by MRI imaging. A differential diagnosis would, however, include a spontaneous cervical epidural hematoma versus cervical epidural empyema versus a possible extramedullary tumor that has possibly bled."
47,T1,T1 (MRI),"LABORATORY DATA: Pending. Her MRI of her brain as in the history of present illness shows infiltrative lesion in the right petrous apex extending to the right cavernous sinus and right clivus best seen on precontrast T1 weighted images, suspicious for metastatic breast cancer.
