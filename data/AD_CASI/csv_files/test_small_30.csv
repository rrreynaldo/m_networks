ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: In summary, Mr. _%#NAME#%_ is a 25-year- old male with a T2 medulloblastoma, status post resection, and now presents for evaluation for postoperative radiation therapy. We agree that the patient would be a candidate for radiation, and Dr. _%#NAME#%_ personally led a discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to radiation therapy with the patient."
2513,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,"She had a genetic study done for SMA, which was still pending at the end of her hospitalization. Because her symptoms aren't typical for SMA, it was recommended that she get an MRI as an outpatient. Her tone was generally considered to be improved by the end of her hospitalization but was still lower than normal for her age."

1783,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,The absence of any such markers can provide reassurance. Level II ultrasound cannot definitively diagnose or exclude the presence of any chromosome condition. * I explained that some couples prefer the definitive information provided by amniocentesis or CVS. Other couples may be uncomfortable with the risk of miscarriage and are sufficiently reassured by screening options. I emphasized that prenatal testing decisions are personal decisions and each couple must make the choice that is right for them.
2127,AVR,aortic valve replacement,2. A left below the knee amputation (BKA) secondary to chronic osteomyelitis which was done _%#MMDD2004#%_. 3. Status post aortic valve replacement (AVR) for which he is on Coumadin and that has been managed by the Coumadin Clinic with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5.

Since his diagnosis of DIP in _%#MM#%_ 2007, he was started on high-dose steroids and had significant improvement in his PFTs and actually had his best FEV-1 since transplant."
1775,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"It was explained to _%#NAME#%_ that because of the invasive nature of the prenatal testing options, they are associated with a risk of miscarriage. The risk for CVS is between 1:200 (0.5%) and 1:100 (1.0%) and the risk for miscarriage with amniocentesis is nationally quoted as 1:200 (0.5%). Karyotype results obtained from these procedures are received approximately 10-14 days after the procedure."
33,T1,thoracic (level) 1,"Given the history of pattern, this most likely represents active demyelination. Minimum nonspecific biventricular white matter changes.

If the patient is eating better, reduce insulin doses and cover in addition with sliding scale."
1226,PDA,posterior descending artery,"I told him that if his angina continues to be at risk that he should not wait that long. I would plan to graft the LAD and diagonal of the internal mammary artery and use the right radial artery for bypassing the PDA and the PLA and possibly vein for the obtuse marginal branch, although it is possible that bypassing that would result in competitive blood flow and either the graft, native artery or both might clot off."
2547,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"The patient was instructed to take a regular diet and to follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in the Heme/Onc Clinic in 6 weeks and to follow up with repeat SMA 10 to assess renal function prior to his appointment with Dr. _%#NAME#%_. The patient was instructed to notify medical doctor if he experienced chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, fever, chills, pain or cough."

1795,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"Both procedures allow for direct fetal chromosomal analysis with 99% accuracy. CVS is offered at 11-13 weeks' gestation and amniocentesis is offered after 15 weeks' gestation. Due to their invasive nature, CVS is nationally associated with a 1:200 (0.5%) to 1:100 (1.0%) risk of miscarriage and amniocentesis is nationally associated with a 1:200 (0.5%) risk of miscarriage."

2440,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,The patient had an a.m. cortisol drawn that next day with thyroid functions which were normal. Urine studies were not consistent with SIADH and the low sodium was presumed secondary to water intoxication. CEA level was normal at 1.9. The patient's sodium level quickly responded and increased to 136. She then contacted me about a week and a half later stating that she felt her appetite was changing some and also felt mildly depressed.

1779,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,Patients who elect to forgo modified sequential screening should still be offered maternal serum AFP screening for spina bifida in the second trimester. * I explained that some couples prefer the definitive information provided by amniocentesis or CVS. Other couples may be uncomfortable with the risk of miscarriage and are sufficiently reassured by screening options. I emphasized that prenatal testing decisions are personal decisions and each couple must make the choice that is right for them.
2283,AMA,against medical advice,"Our plan was to increase his beta-blockade and repeat a transesophageal echocardiogram in 3 days. At this point, the patient stood up and left the hospital, or at least the immediate area of 4E. He signed a AMA (or Against Medical Advice) form prior to leaving the ward.

3542,T4,thyroxine,"2. Goiter. The patient will have a chest x-ray which if it shows no signs of tracheal deviation and her T4 is not significantly elevated, she would be cleared for potential surgery if her hypothyroidism was treated. I will wait for a T4 before we begin any treatment. The patient's goiter is not substernal and I feel that no further imaging is needed. The patient would be at risk for acute hyperthyroidism if she received iodinated contrast."

The patient originally was scheduled for a cystectomy with the outside urologist, but due to the fact that it was just a T1 tumor he did discuss the possibility of just doing a re-resection and proceeding with BCG therapy. At this point, the patient presents now for a re-resection of his tumor."
1577,RT,respiratory therapy,"The patient was transferred to the ICU in stable condition where postop course renal consult was obtained for chronic renal failure, dialysis dependent anemia, volume overload, all secondary to chronic renal failure.

1222,PDA,posterior descending artery,"While it is possible that the inferior wall was actually infarcted from the left PDA and that she had spasm of the LAD, we felt that the diffuse EKG changes were more supportive of Tako-Tsubo. It is conceivable that what happened was she developed Tako-Tsubo in the same chronic left PDA lesion and that with the left ventricle dilating, this increased wall stress and was causing intermittent angina from the left PDA."
2463,CVP,"cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone",Bone marrow biopsy _%#MMDD2004#%_ showed 30 percent involvement with a low-grade lymphoproliferative disorder with plasmacytic differentiation consistent with a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma or possible Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.
