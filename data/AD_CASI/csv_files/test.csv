Risk assessment for chromosome conditions: * We discussed the association between maternal age and an increasing risk for chromosome conditions, such as Down syndrome."
120,IVF,in vitro fertilization,"The mother's pregnancy was complicated by a previous SAB from IVF with donor eggs. This pregnancy was also the product of IVF with donor eggs. Multiple ultrasounds were performed, but the earliest ones (_%#MMDD#%_, _%#MMDD#%_, _%#MMDD#%_) showed a ""pericardial effusion"" in twin A."
121,IVF,in vitro fertilization,The patient's gynecological history is also significant for secondary infertility which she states was treated with multiple D&C's. She also attempted several IVF cycles without success. Her past OB history is significant for normal spontaneous vaginal delivery followed by retained placenta and a postpartum hemorrhage necessitating emergent D&C.
122,IVF,in vitro fertilization,"The patient did undergo her first IVF cycle in _%#MM#%_ of 2006, which did not result in pregnancy.

134,IVF,in vitro fertilization,"She reported no smoking, alcohol use, medications, or problems with this pregnancy. They did not have specific reasons for the infertility issues, but certainly were excited with this pregnancy being achieved on the first IVF cycle. I reviewed that at the age of 39 her chance to have a baby with any type of chromosome abnormality is approximately 1 in 83."
135,IVF,intravenous fluid,Problems during the hospitalization included the following: 1. FEN: Initially the baby was made NPO secondary to the respiratory distress and placed on maintenance IVF. Once her respiratory status was stable she given gavage feeds and the IVF was titrated down. Later she attempted breastfeeding. The admission glucose was 68.

He has swelling and tenderness along the DIP joint. He is able to move the DIP joint but has some limited motion secondary to swelling. He has tense and exquisite tenderness over the nail bed proximally.
272,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"It appears to extend through both neurovascular bundles. However, there is some capillary refill to the distal digit. It is at the level distal to the DIP joint. It is not amendable to microvascular repair, but capillary refill does indicate collateral flow maintaining perfusion. Flexor tendon is lacerated and there is obvious segmental injury to the DIP joint."
273,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Pain in hand and foot. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of gouty arthropathy and status post right hand surgery on _%#MMDD2007#%_, who presents from clinic with complaints of right hand and foot pain. The pain is predominantly in her right first digit DIP joint, third digit PIP joint and DIP joint of her foot. The right hand joint pain has been present for some time and she actually had surgery on _%#MMDD2007#%_, of the second and third digits but since the surgery the pain has increased and she has noticed new pain, swelling in redness of her first digit that was not present before."
274,DIP,distal interphalangeal,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 56-year-old female who presents status post left foot surgery which consisted of a left triple fusion and second toe DIP surgery. The patient apparently tolerated the surgery well without complications that I can see. At the present time the patient is complaining of constipation.
275,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"The patient's hand was thoroughly irrigated and debrided after digital blocks were performed. Following this, the flaps of the ring finger which was amputated at the DIP joint level was then trimmed and fashioned to cover the defect. I did not rongeur the remaining bone at this time as it was at the DIP joint level."
276,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"Her radial styloid is tender. Her circulation, motor and sensory functions are intact. She has arthritic changes in the hands, particularly in the DIP joints. Radiographs show an undisplaced distal radius fracture. This is a very simple fracture, which should be stable, can be treated in a cast."
277,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"No previous surgeries. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. PHYSICAL EXAM: He has a complex laceration with longitudinal split and ulnarly based flap that extends from the proximal germinal matrix region to past the PIP joint with obvious comminuted fracture with displacement and deformity, excessive flexion deformity indicating loss of tenodesis and extensor mechanism at both the DIP and PIP joint. There appears to be some subluxation of portions of the joint surface and the middle phalanx. Sensibility was not tested because of numbness from the digital block in the emergency room but was reported to have sensibility."
278,DIP,distal interphalangeal,When she makes a fist she is unable to pull the distal phalanx down. She can bend at the PIP joint but not at the DIP joint. She has pain and tenderness over the mid portion of the ring finger of the middle phalanx. She does not have tenderness at the base of the A-1 pulley.

283,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Cellulitis right ring fever. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 26-year-old right hand dominant otherwise healthy gentleman currently unemployed, usually works as a construction worker, who cut the dorsal aspect of his ring finger at the DIP joint approximately 36 hours ago on his tool box. Since that time he has had progressive pain, swelling and loss of function in his finger."
284,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Otherwise healthy. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: A healthy-appearing young man has obvious injury to the index finger. There is a transverse laceration through the level of the DIP joint from the saw injury. It appears to extend through both neurovascular bundles. However, there is some capillary refill to the distal digit."
285,DIP,desquamative interstitial pneumonia,"The patient has been on high-dose prednisone since. His pulmonary function tests have shown some improvement. Repeat bronchoscopy on _%#MMDD2007#%_ showed a recurrence of his DIP. Hence, kept on prednisone at 30 mg p.o. b.i.d. 3. Congestive heart failure secondary to idiopathic cardiomyopathy. His last known ejection fraction is 25%."

Status post left parotid gland removal in 1999."
292,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"There are no cuts or abrasions over the hand. There is evidence of an old puncture, approximately 3 mm in diameter in the flexor crease of the PIP joint. She has swelling in her finger. The finger is held in flexion at the DIP, PIP and MP joints. Attempts at extension resulted in significant pain. Her neurologic exam, including sensory motor function is normal."
293,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"It is well perfused and sensate, but it definitely has a different shape than the contralateral little finger. He is unable to meaningfully flex the MP and PIP joints, although he can wiggle the DIP joint. I reviewed Park Nicollet x-rays which show an oblique or spiral fracture through the mid portion of the proximal phalanx."
294,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"SKIN: Across the extremities, but not the trunk, there is a macular papular rash with water blisters. Her nails are without splinter hemorrhages. JOINTS: Her DIP and PIP joints are tender and she cannot close her fingers fully. She does have some deformity from arthritis. Her elbows and toes are nontender."
295,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"Normal S1, S2. No murmur, gallop, or rub. ABDOMEN - slightly tender in the lower abdomen, otherwise the exam was somewhat limited by her obesity but I saw no hepatosplenomegaly or masses. EXTREMITIES - the following joints were examined for range of motion, tenderness, and swelling and were found to be without abnormality except where noted: The DIP, PIP, MCP, wrist, elbow, glenohumeral, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular, temporomandibular, hip, knee, tibiotalar, subtalar, MTP, and IP joints bilaterally. The exceptions were the right first MCP joint had grade II swelling and tenderness, was warm and erythematous."
296,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"No palpable masses or organomegaly. EXTREMITIES: Acyanotic without clubbing or peripheral edema. It is noted that on this left hand, the left ring finger, and left middle finger are amputated for the DIP distally. SKIN: No rashes noted. NEUROLOGIC: Alert and oriented. Cranial nerves 2 through 7 are grossly intact. Subjectively sensation to light touch on his left thumb and pointer finger are decreased when compared to the contralateral hand, otherwise sensation to light touch is intact and equal throughout the upper extremities and lower extremities bilaterally."
297,DIP,distal interphalangeal,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Macrodactyly of the left index and long finger. MAJOR PROCEDURE: 1. Left index and long finger DIP fusion debulking. 2. Left long finger osteotomy. HOSPITAL COURSE: After the patient underwent the above- mentioned procedure the patient tolerated the procedure well.
298,DIP,distal interphalangeal,"EXTREMITIES: Exam of the left hand reveals swelling but essentially no tenderness of the left middle finger PIP joint. There is about a 40 degree flexion contracture of the joint itself and some mild stiffness of the DIP joint. Neurovascular exam is intact. X-rays of the left middle finger (AP, lateral) taken at Queen of Peace on _%#MMDD2007#%_ and interpreted by me reveal a volar dislocation of the PIP joint."
299,DIP,desquamative interstitial pneumonia,"He presents with increasing shortness of breath going on for the last 2 weeks at least. Since his diagnosis of DIP in _%#MM#%_ 2007, he was started on high-dose steroids and had significant improvement in his PFTs and actually had his best FEV-1 since transplant."

302,C4,(complement) component 4,"Urinalysis was essentially normal. Her admission white blood cell count was 10,000 with a 90 percent lymphocyte count. It was also noted that two weeks prior to admission, the had a multitude of labs showing liver function, normal C3 and C4 complement levels, the absence of any lupus inhibitor or cardiolipin IgG or IgM as well as the absence of ___________ antibody in the testing."
303,C4,(complement) component 4,"Liver function tests are minimally elevated except for the LDH which is quite a bit elevated. The haptoglobin is low. Reticulocyte count could not be done because of ""interfering substances."" C3 and C4 are normal. Screening chemistries are normal, although initially a potassium was slightly low. Thank you very much for the chance to see this pleasant woman."
304,C4,cervical (level) 4,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 58-year-old female with a known history of COPD, alcoholic polyneuropathy, and a known history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension who was admitted to the acute rehab unit following a complex neck surgery that she had for a severe central canal stenosis at the level of C4-5 that was performed on _%#MMDD2006#%_. The surgery included C4-5 carpectomies with a decompression of the spinal cord and bilateral C4, C5, and C6 nerves and C3 to C7 anterior spinal fusion and instrumentation and fibular allograft and local allograft procedure."
305,C4,cervical (level) 4,"He appears to have had a remote C1-2 level injury with marked degenerative arthritis and pain. On the day of admission, he underwent an uncomplicated occipital C4 fusion. The indications for a fusion of that length were that he was in essence spontaneously fused between the occiput and ring of C1, and C2, C3, and C4 were spontaneously fused."
306,C4,(complement) component 4,"Electron microscopy is pending. Further studies demonstrated significant deposition of type III collagen in glomeruli suggestive of type III glomerulopathy. Lab studies also demonstrated low C3 with normal C4 complement level Because of known association of factor H deficiency and type III collagen glomerulopathy, factor H studies were sent, the result of which is still pending."
307,C4,cervical (level) 4,"She did have brain resection in 1999 and since then has been seizure-free. 4. Degenerative joint disease of the spine, diagnosed in _%#MM2000#%_ with stenosis and bone spurs around C4 and C5. 5. Carpal tunnel syndrome bilaterally diagnosed four months ago, presently seeing a neurosurgeon. 6. Hepatitis, most likely A. The patient explains that there was acute inflammation of her liver when she was 11 years old and it has since resolved."
308,C4,(complement) component 4,"The creatinine to 1.6 relatively stable a high of 1.7. A large batter of labs were ordered during the course of hospitalization to determine the cause of the renal failure. These included a complement C3 and C4, ASO and anti-DNase B titers, FANA, ANCA, sedimentation rate, CRP, and a glomerular basement membrane. All labs were within normal limits with the exception of ASO titer which was elevated at 2,100."
309,C4,cervical (level) 4,"There is also some abnormal enhancement anterior to C4. There is evidence of neck adenopathy bilaterally. There is no spinal canal compromise. CT SCAN OF CERVICAL SPINE: CT shows lytic destruction of C4 with a wedge compression deformity. This also shows bilateral adenopathy. BONE SCAN: Scan is negative with no abnormality seen anywhere, including in the C4 region."
310,C4,cervical (level) 4,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 61-year-old white female with history of C5 intramedullary mass. She underwent bilateral laminectomies at C5, C6 and caudal C4, biopsy and subtotal tumor resection on _%#MMDD2006#%_. Biopsy results revealed astrocytoma consistent with pilocystic variant, Malignant feature cannot be ruled out."
311,C4,cervical (level) 4,"She was seen by the Pain Service. She failed a test dose of intrathecal analgesia, presumably, in retrospect, due to the fact that she has nearly complete block of the spinal canal at C4 through approximately T1 or T2. This was demonstrated on MRI of the chest on _%#MMDD2003#%_. The patient was subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, where she was started on a ketamine drip."
312,C4,(complement) component 4,"5. Rheumatology. In consultation with _%#NAME#%_'s primary rheumatologist, her lupus was managed initially with a burst of Solu-Medrol followed by prednisone. She had a double-stranded DNA level of 3110. She also had complement levels drawn demonstrating C3 level of 35 and a C4 level of 11. These were consistent with her outpatient laboratory results. Additionally, her ALT and AST were followed for liver involvement."
313,C4,cervical (level) 4,"MRI of the brain on _%#MMDD2006#%_ show small hyperintense lesion with central hypointensity in several sites also suspicious for metastatic disease. His MRI of the cervical pine showed osteopenic vertebral body C3, C4, and C5. Borderline small spinal canal without evidence of spinal cord compression. Mild degenerative changes in the cervical spine. MRI of the thoracic spine obtained on _%#MMDD2006#%_ showed multiple metastatic spinal cord lesions, right lung and left pleural base lesions."
314,C4,(complement) component 4,"On admission, his vital signs were within normal limits. His physical examination was also within normal limits with the exception of a small patch of dermatitis on his left anterior shin. ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: CBC was normal. Normal IgE level. Normal C3, and C4 levels. HOSPITAL COURSE: PROBLEM #1: Provocative food challenge. The patient completed a MSG provocative food challenge, including placebo doses, per allergy protocol."
315,C4,cervical (level) 4,He had no radicular component to this. Because of his history of neurofibromatosis a MRI scan was done revealing substantial neurofibroma in the mid cervical area. There were numerous neurofibromas with the largest one being at C4 level resulting in a significant mass effect and distortion of the cervical cord. For that reason the patient was referred to Dr. _%#NAME#%_ who is recommending cervical laminectomy for removal of this tumor.
316,C4,cluster of differentiation 4:CD4,"We will likely have ID consulted and may need EGD by Gastrointestinal for further assessment. 2. HIV AIDS. Unclear of her current C4 and viral load. She states it has not been checked in some time, I believe during her last hospital admission."
317,C4,cervical (level) 4,"She remained neurologically intact. Spinal cord monitoring was unchanged. She was mobilized in a rigid orthosis. After discussion, with particular concerns for late graft complications, a posterior cervical fusion from C4 to C7 was carried out. Solid fixation was achieved with standard lateral mass and trans-spinous process cabling, occasional lateral mass plating and trans-spinous process cable fixation."
318,C4,cervical (level) 4,Cervical spine films were performed but showed advance and generally with hypertrophic changes in the mid and lower cervical spine with narrowing at C5 and minimal anterior subluxation of C3 on C4. Chest x- ray showed some chronic interstitial changes. X-ray of the thumb showed no fracture. The patient had symptoms of weakness in the left upper extremity.
319,C4,cluster of differentiation 4:CD4,"He had some lab studies done recently, but they are not available for review at this time. Last labs I see are from _%#MM2003#%_, at which time his C4 count was 139 and his viral load was 20,273. The patient's medications include Bactrim, trazodone, Trizivir, Lexapro, Kaletra, Protonix, and Mucinex."

As I was unable to reduce this patient's injury in a closed fashion in the office, she therefore presents at this time for possible surgical management by my partner, Dr. _%#NAME#%_."
470,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"This patient denies prior history of problems with her right hand. She was always able to fully extend the middle finger MP joint. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for osteoarthritis, hypercholesterolemia, hiatal hernia, water retention, and depression."
471,MP,metatarsophalangeal/metacarpophalangeal,"She does have in her left hand ecchymosis and swelling over the ulnar border of the hand including between the third between the fourth and fifth metacarpals. This is mildly restricts the flexion in the MP joint, but not substantially. There is no diminished sensation. Color and circulation is good in the fingers and hand other than the ecchymotic sites."
472,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General - the patient has multiple deformities from her arthritis, especially her hands with ulnar deviations at the MP joints. Her ABDOMEN is obese. There is a midline surgical incision from the umbilicus to the pubis. There is no palpable hernia because of the amount of subcutaneous tissue."
473,MP,metatarsophalangeal,"She has difficulty with shoe wear because of it. On examination, there is no dorsiflexion to the left great toe at all. She has marginal spur formation that is both visible and palpable so that the MP joint of the left great toe is much larger than the right. X-rays demonstrate some narrowing of the MP joint space together with marginal spurs."
474,MP,mercaptopurine,"_%#NAME#%_ tolerated his chemotherapy well with minimal nausea and no emesis. At the time of discharge, he was in no apparent distress and was afebrile. He went home with daily doses of 6 MP which they plan to crush, at home, to help swallowing. Also at the time of his discharge he was switched from dapsone to Bactrim, which was also to be crushed and mixed in with his food for PCP prophylaxis."
475,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"There is no swelling and no significant tenderness. I am unable to extend the ulnar three MP joints at all. The index finger MP joint can almost be completely extended but it does not stay in place. The left hand has no swelling, tenderness, or limitation of motion."
476,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"There is a 15 x 15 mm area of fluctuance, swelling and tenderness along the radial volar base of the index finger. The erythema extends only to the level of the MP joint. There does not appear to be significant tenderness over the flexor tendon sheath and there is no significant increase of pain with passive motion of the flexor tendons."
477,MP,mercaptopurine,As noted Dr. _%#NAME#%_ did colonoscopy which on biopsy proved to show Crohn's disease. The patient was treated with steroid and also we added Remicade and 6- MP to her regimen. Within a few more days her bowel pattern started to improve and at the time of discharge bowels are still a little bit more frequent but are formed.
478,MP,mercaptopurine,"She also had no clear resection of her Crohn's disease. 4. Hypertension. 5. Breast reduction in 1998. MEDICATIONS: At the time of admission include: 1. 6 MP. 2. Lisinopril. 3.

479,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"There is a laceration over the long finger. He has full active extension of that long finger. He does not have any tenderness over the volar aspect of the MP joint of the long finger. On the ring finger, he has a bite mark that measures about 12 mm in the fourth dorsal webspace, not directly over the extensor tendon, but he does have significant tenderness over the MP joint on the volar aspect."
480,MP,metatarsophalangeal/metacarpophalangeal,"Neurovascular exam is intact. X-rays of the left thumb (multiple views) taken at the Oxboro Clinic on _%#MMDD2004#%_ reveal an intracondylar T fracture of the proximal phalanx into the MP joint.

482,MP,metatarsophalangeal,"The MP joint has significant callus with a small ulcer that does not seem to track very deeply. On probing on the lateral aspect over the MP joint of the foot though, he has a greater ulcer and some skin necrosis overlying it. I am unable to express any purulence with some effort and the packing that was removed from that ulcer was relatively clean."
483,MP,metatarsophalangeal/metacarpophalangeal,"He is employed at Lenox Frame and Finishing. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: A healthy-appearing gentleman with obvious injury to the left index finger with a 4- to 5-cm oblique laceration extending along the dorsal aspect and radial aspect of the MP joint extending down volarly. Active flexion with the FDP is intact. The collateral ligament appears to have some laxity, although difficult to assess secondary to pain and guarding."
484,MP,mercaptopurine,"It was felt that the patient had a flare-up of her ulcerative colitis. She will be maintained on her same maintenance treatment with 6 MP 75 mg a day, along with her Rowasa enema and Canasa suppository and her Asacol 4800 mg a day divided in three doses at 1600 mg three times a day."

487,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"There is certainly no history of trauma either from a fall or from local venous access. At this time, the patient complains of pain isolated to the index MP joint. He has a redness in the area and discomfort with motion. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for: 1. Diverticulosis. 2. Prostate cancer."
488,MP,mercaptopurine,"REQUESTING PHYSICIAN: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, MD _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 65-year-old man with a history of Crohn's disease diagnosed in 2000 treated with prednisone with some improvement, tapered off prednisone several times over the last year but always relapses, on prednisone in varying doses for 6-7 months of this year. Also on 75 mg of 6 MP. Apparently had epistaxis in higher doses. Also takes calcium for osteoporosis. He was on Remicade this year and took at least two courses, but developed some type of itching."
489,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"While patient was placed on antibiotics, Orthopedics evaluated the patient and felt that this was consistent with gout rather than septic joint. The patient underwent injection of the left wrist and left third MP and PIP joints with marked improvement of her symptoms. Additionally, patient had an elevated creatinine upon admission which resolved with appropriate treatment."
490,MP,metabolic panel,"Her uterus was very difficult to examine secondary to the procedures felt small with no masses. LABORATORY DATA: Hemoglobin 17.3.

Sensation is grossly intact although somewhat limited examination limited by the splint."
494,MP,mercaptopurine,"Bone marrow biopsy had 70% cellularity. Fish was negative for BCR ......and normal cytogenetics. The second induction of chemotherapy included 6 MP, Cytoxan, cytarabine, vincristine, and intrathecal methotrexate, which was completed on _%#MMDD2004#%_. Two days later, she had a fever of 101.5 and a large right IJ clot associated with her Hickman."
495,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"Any attempts to grip give him sharp pain. At rest he has dull pain. He has no numbness or tingling. The pain is mostly around the MP joint. He also suffered some bruising to the arm and forearm, but no other significant injuries. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for appendectomy. He has had a greater tuberosity fracture of the shoulder."
496,MP,metacarpophalangeal,"There is an extended puncture wound in the palm along the third ray which appears clean without drainage; this is about 5.0-mm in length. There is tenderness around this area and some extending up to the MP joint. There is no tenderness extending up into the finger, however. There is no circumferential swelling of the digit and no pain with passive motion."
497,MP,metatarsophalangeal/metacarpophalangeal,"She has full active extension at therapy MP, PIP and DIP joint. IMPRESSION: Flexor tendon laceration that is only retracted to the MP joint level. PLAN: Is to proceed with a flexor tendon repair. Her surgery is being scheduled for _%#MMDD#%_."

674,PCP,Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia,"His viral lobe was either 15,000 or 150,000. He has a history of thrush that was noted three months ago, and he was treated with medications for the thrush. He denies a history of PCP, MAI, or Caprices sarcoma. 3. History of withdrawal seizures that required treatment with barbiturates x 16 days. Apparently, the patient was in some type of barbiturate-induce coma secondary to the seizures."
675,PCP,primary care physician,"We talked about follow up with the primary care physician and the possible need for referral to an allergist to ascertain the exact cause of the reaction. Also for a prescription for an EpiPen junior to have it all the time as deemed appropriate by the PCP. I told mom that the next reaction could be the same, or possibly worse, and she needs to be ready for that."
676,PCP,primary care physician,She is diagnosed in _%#DDMM2002#%_ and was treated with external beam radiation. She had no problems until _%#DDMM2006#%_ when a CT scan done by her PCP showed a large right upper lobe mass approximately 5 x 5 cm. This was biopsied and showed metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with endometrial origin.
677,PCP,phencyclidine,"AST is 47. Troponins are negative times 3. White blood cell count 11,900, hemoglobin 16, hematocrit 49. Drug tox screen is positive for amphetamine use, positive for THC, positive for opiates, positive for tricyclics, negative for PCP, methadone, and cocaine. Chest x-ray shows complete right opacification as well as what appear to be metallic foreign bodies."
678,PCP,Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia,"He was started on Rocephin and Zithromax and seemed to be improving, but now in the last couple days has continued to have temperatures going into the 101 degree range with sweats, chills, malaise and no apparent response. He has had a bronchoscopy done just yesterday with no obvious immediate answer present. PCP prep and most of the smears are still pending. Cultures have all been negative so far. He feels no different now than when he came in the hospital so far."
679,PCP,primary care physician,"4. Prednisone 40 mg daily x2 days, given to her by her primary care physician for possible inflammation associated with this retrosternal chest pain. 5. Magic mouthwash x2 days given to her by her PCP to help her swallow the prednisone. 6. Multivitamin daily. SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her parents and her brother in an apartment in _%#CITY#%_."
680,PCP,Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia,Mr. _%#NAME#%_ will also continue to receive prophylactic Levaquin 250 mg daily while receiving corticosteroids.

She was admitted for repetitive fevers and was found on CT scan to have a left hilar mass."
684,PCP,Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia,He is recovering from Pneumocystis pneumonia. PLAN: 1. We asked the patient to discontinue his clindamycin and Primaquine today. We will lower his Valganciclovir dosage to 400 mg b.i.d. We will prescribe atovaquone 750 mg b.i.d. and his PCP treatment and/or prophylaxis. 2. I gave him Librax 1 p.o. b.i.d. for gastrointestinal cramping. 3. We will put him on Vioxx 25 mg q.d. and an anti-inflammatory drug.
685,PCP,Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia,"PROBLEM #3: Infectious disease. _%#NAME#%_'s CMV and HSV negative. He remained afebrile throughout this admission. He was discharged on fluconazole. Bactrim was held secondary to its myelosuppressive effects and should be restarted for PCP prophylaxis when his absolute neutrophil count is greater than or equal to 1,000 for two consecutive days. At discharge his white blood cell count was 0.2. Ceftin was added for antibacterial prophylaxis and should continue until Nat engrafts."

The patient has old tests available, but no further current tests were available at this time. On review of old laboratory data, a TSH of 0.49 was normal on _%#DDMM2003#%_."
687,PCP,Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia,"_%#NAME#%_ is asplenic so gatifloxacin was initiated for encapsulated organism prophylaxis at discharge. He will continue on prophylactic acyclovir therapy through day 100. He is also on Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis. PROBLEM #3: Graft-versus-host disease. _%#NAME#%_ was weaned from systemic steroids, and cyclosporin was discontinued during his last admission to induce a graft versus leukemia effect secondary to his relapsing disease."
688,PCP,Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia,"I would favor this as a relapse of Pneumocystis as he has not been on secondary prophylaxis. I doubt he needs vancomycin or Zosyn, but would favor Levaquin, Septra to cover community acquired pneumonia, atypical pathogens, and PCP. 2. Bloody diarrhea, new. Differential includes CMV, bacterial, C. difficile colitis, fungal, paracytic. Paracytic is less likely. 3. Chronic pancytopenia and red cell aplasia."

691,PCP,Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia,"At that time he was found to have liver metastases, bone metastases, and involvement of the lymph nodes. Currently, the patient is intubated secondary to acute respiratory failure with PCP pneumonia and progressively lung cancer. The patient continues to be hypotensive/sepsis and is on pressor support. Family has gathered to support wife in decision making and clarification of treatment goals."
692,PCP,Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia,"3. We will also start her today on Bactrim DS b.i.d. for any possible PCP, because of the fact that she is on prednisone and methotrexate. 4. We will send for blood cultures and sputum cultures, and check also for PCP. 5. Providing that the cultures are negative, we will continue with the antibiotics for ten days. 6. As the patient gets better, we will start to ambulate her, and test whether or not she needs oxygen."
693,PCP,Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia,"MMF was discontinued. 3. Infectious disease. The patient has been afebrile for the last 4 days. Blood cultures are negative to date.

821,T2,T2 (MRI),It was thought that it was unlikely that this was CNS lupus and did discuss the abnormal T2 hyperintensity with neuroradiology and upon further review; I thought that this was likely artifact or that the T2 hyperintensity was due to the degenerative changes. The paresthesias that she is describing are consistent with Lhermitte's syndrome and that could be due to the degenerative changes seen on MRI.
822,T2,T2 (MRI),"The bowel gas pattern is nonobstructive. On _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006, MRI of the C-spine and brain was performed with and without contrast with the following results: Suboptimal study due to significant patient motion.

Chest x-ray PA and lateral shows an apparent right-sided infiltrate affecting the right cardiac silhouette and right hemidiaphragm. We will await Radiology overread. The 12-lead ECG shows some inferior Q waves and occasional PVCs."
1160,PA,posterior-anterior,"There is no tenderness. Distal extremities are normal. There is no peripheral edema. The patient has no prior history of bleeding problems. At today's visit, a PA chest x-ray, CBC, basic metabolic panel, INR and PTT were all drawn and results should be available prior to his upcoming surgery."
1161,PA,posterior-anterior,Vital were normal. LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC DATA: White count was 5100 with hemoglobin of 13.7. Electrolytes were normal. Hepatic panel was normal. BNP was 23. PA and lateral chest x-ray showed no acute changes. Urinalysis was unremarkable. CT scan of the abdomen was obtained and would show changes in the left lower quadrant that would be compatible with colitis.

She was seen at the _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ Ob/Gyn Clinic, PA on _%#DDMM2003#%_ at which time she had a urinalysis which was consistent with a bladder infection. She was placed on Macrobid to treat that. She had no flank pain and no additional pain."
1163,PA,posterior-anterior,"Full range of motion seen throughout. NEUROLOGIC: Grossly nonfocal. LABORATORY FINDINGS: Review of labs drawn at _%#CITY#%_ _%#CITY#%_ Medical Center shows a normal CBC. Chest x-ray, which I have reviewed and interpreted personally, shows a somewhat poor quality film on the PA projection. There is a suggestion of infiltrate primarily in the left lower lobe. The lateral projection also suggests an infiltrate in the lower lung fields."
1164,PA,pulmonary artery,"He had undergone a transplant work-up which included an initial catheterization on _%#DDMM2003#%_ which Mr. _%#NAME#%_ tolerated well. Findings at that time included a right atrial pressure of 8 and 12, right ventricular pressure was 66/20, PA pressure was 66/36, wedge was 36, and cardiac index was not listed.

1213,PDA,patent ductus arteriosus,"3. Cardiovascular: Initial chest x-ray revealed an enlarged heart. Pre- and post-ductal oxygen saturations revealed a 10% difference. For this reason a cardiac echo was performed and revealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (diabetic cardiomyopathy), PDA and patent foramen ovale. No treatment was necessary. 4. Gastrointestinal: _%#NAME#%_ experienced gastroesophageal reflux. He was started on zantac, reglan and reflux precautions. These medications have been discontinued."
1214,PDA,posterior descending artery,"His native LAD had an 80-90% stenosis and this was angioplastied and stented. The native right coronary artery was completely occluded, but a widely patent saphenous vein graft was seen with a PDA stenosis. The circumflex artery had mild disease.

Continued on Zantac for reflux diagnosed by UGI at Rice Memorial Hospital."
1222,PDA,posterior descending artery,"While it is possible that the inferior wall was actually infarcted from the left PDA and that she had spasm of the LAD, we felt that the diffuse EKG changes were more supportive of Tako-Tsubo. It is conceivable that what happened was she developed Tako-Tsubo in the same chronic left PDA lesion and that with the left ventricle dilating, this increased wall stress and was causing intermittent angina from the left PDA."

Status post complete repair with resection of pulmonary valve and infundibular muscle and LPA plasty status post PDA ligation. No residual shunting at the level of the ventricles. Wide open pulmonary regurgitation. 2. Small for gestational age. Birth weight of 2.5 kg.
1224,PDA,posterior descending artery,"There was an occluded saphenous vein graft to M1 segment of the graft from M1-M2, patent filling from native circumflex, which has severe diffuse disease. There is a patent LIMA graft to diagonal, LAD, and patent saphenous vein graft to PDA. Recommendation was medical management versus a redo of CABG. According to the patient's wife, medical management was the plan at that time according to the patient's primary MD and primary cardiologist."
1225,PDA,posterior descending artery,"Left circumflex ended after getting a large OM. Right coronary artery with large dominant vessel giving posterior long PLA after the PDA. The report was consistent with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, idiopathic versus tachycardia mediated. Repeat echocardiogram was performed before putting in the pacemaker. It showed the presence of a small thrombus in the left arterial appendage."
1226,PDA,posterior descending artery,"I told him that if his angina continues to be at risk that he should not wait that long. I would plan to graft the LAD and diagonal of the internal mammary artery and use the right radial artery for bypassing the PDA and the PLA and possibly vein for the obtuse marginal branch, although it is possible that bypassing that would result in competitive blood flow and either the graft, native artery or both might clot off."
1227,PDA,posterior descending artery,"BUN and creatinine were normal. Platelet count was normal. ALT and AST were within normal limits. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent coronary angiography which revealed patent grafts. The graft to the PDA was also patent. There was a 90% stenosis in the small _____ posterolateral branch at the origin. All of the graft of the PDA was patent because of the stenosis at the origin of the PLA, this vessel could be potential cause of his angina."
1228,PDA,patent ductus arteriosus,"Problem #3: Cardiovascular. _%#NAME#%_ had an echocardiogram on _%#DDMM2007#%_ which revealed severe pulmonary hypertension, mild tricuspid regurgitation and a small patent ductus arteriosus. An alprostadil drip was started on _%#DDMM2007#%_ to allow increased R->L blood flow through the PDA given very high pulmonary artery pressures. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was contemplated. A repeat echocardiogram on _%#DDMM2007#%_ showed slight improvement in the pulmonary hypertension and a widely patent ductus arteriosus with bidirectional flow."
1229,PDA,posterior descending artery,"At that time he had a left internal mammary artery to his LAD and endarterectomy with his right coronary artery with saphenous vein graft to his PDA segment of the right coronary artery. The patient awoke soon after his operation, did well in the Intensive Care Unit and was transferred to the floor on the first postoperative day."
1230,PDA,patent ductus arteriosus,"Problem #2: Cardiovascular. _%#NAME#%_ had an echocardiogram on _%#DDMM2007#%_ due to a systolic soft, grade II/VI murmur. Results of the ECHO are as follows: No PDA, small PFO with left to right flow, normal anatomy and function. Problem #3: Hyperbilirubinemia. _%#NAME#%_'s blood type is O positive. Maternal blood type is O positive."
1231,PDA,posterior descending artery,"IMPRESSION: 1. Suspected but not proven unstable angina. 2. Coronary artery disease. 3. Previous five-vessel bypass as noted above with bypass to LAD, diagonal, OMI, OM, and distal PDA of RCA. 4. Diminished LV function in the past. EF of 40%. 5. Systolic apical murmur. 6. Coronary artery disease. PLAN: As above."
1232,PDA,posterior descending artery,"He ruled out for a myocardial infarction. The decision was made to proceed with coronary angiography which demonstrated a high grade stenosis within the mid right coronary artery of 95%. There was competitive flow distally with evidence of contralateral collaterals. The patient also had mild distal PDA stenosis at 30-40%, PLA stenosis of 30%, and 20% proximal LAD stenosis, 30% proximal circumflex artery stenosis with a 60% stenosis before the first obtuse marginal."
1233,PDA,patent ductus arteriosus,Pharmacy will follow kidney function and gentamicin levels. Cardiovascular Surgery consultation will be necessary at some point. I expect a surgical repair of the PDA and subaortic membrane may be necessary after a full course of antibiotics has been performed and this infection has been cured.
1234,PDA,posterior descending artery,"2. History of diverticulosis found on screening colonoscopy approximately five or six years ago. 3. Degenerative joint disease. 4. Hypertension. 5. PDA repair in 1957. 6. Status post ovarian cystectomy, nephrectomy, c-section, hysteroscopy. 7. Elevated lipids. 8. History of labyrinthitis. MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, baby aspirin, Avapro, Lipitor, Os-Cal, vitamin E and garlic."
1235,PDA,posterior descending artery,"He has had multiple surgeries including a PENA procedure to correct a bladder/rectal fistula. In _%#MM#%_ 1993 procedures were performed to closed a PDA and ASD. In _%#MM#%_ 1994 a procedure to close the colostomy was done. In _%#MM#%_ 1994 he had a circumcision, laparoscopy, orchiopexy as well as placement of PE tubes and bone marrow aspiration."
1236,PDA,posterior descending artery,"Her last sodium was 136 and her last potassium was 3.9 on _%#DDMM2002#%_. 6. Cardiovascular- A cardiac echo on _%#MMDD#%_ showed normal cardiac anatomy with good LV and RV function and no PDA. 7. Ophthalmology- A retinal exam on _%#MMDD#%_ showed posterior zone 2, grade 2 retinopathy. A repeat exam was suggested for _%#MMDD#%_."
1237,PDA,patent ductus arteriosus,"Cultures were negative. Problem #5: Cardiovascular. _%#NAME#%_ had an echocardiogram on _%#DDMM2006#%_ due to the diaphragmatic hernia which revealed PFO vs ASD, and that the heart was displaced to the right secondary to the diaphragmatic hernia. There was evidence of bi-directional shunting at the PDA and atrial levels. Repeat echo was normal. Problem #6: Surgical. _%#NAME#%_ required surgery for congenital diaphragmatic hernia on _%#DDMM2006#%_."
1238,PDA,posterior descending artery,The RCA has mild proximal disease. The mid vessel has 75% stenosis. The distal vessel has moderate stenosis. There is an early take- off PDA supplying a distal PDA territory and the smaller PDA supplying a proximal territory. Just distal to the PDA take-off the ostia of PLA is 100% occluded and fills the collaterals.
1239,PDA,patent ductus arteriosus,"Prior to her discharge, she showed appropriate weight gain, taking full nutritional requirements orally without difficulty. 2. Cardiology- Initial ECHO showed an Ebstein malformation with severe tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonary insufficiency, a patent PDA, and a small ASD. Follow up ECHO on _%#DDMM2004#%_ demonstrated a persistently patent, small ductus arteriosus. She was placed on a short course of PGE, pressor support was required until DOL 7 to maintain mean arterial pressures, and nitric oxide was given to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance."
1240,PDA,patent ductus arteriosus,"Initial thyroid function tests done on _%#DDMM2004#%_ showed TSH 11.5 and free T4 2.5, which were both somewhat elevated, but not consistent with hypothyroidism (T4 would be low). Cardiac echo done showed small bi-directional PDA and small left to right shunt through PFO, with overall function of heart was within normal limits. Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ from the Down Syndrome Clinic at FUMC spoke with _%#NAME#%_' parents, and _%#NAME#%_ will be seen in Dr. _%#NAME#%_'s clinic after discharge."
1241,PDA,posterior descending artery,"On left ventriculography there was inferobasilar hypokinesis with a mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function. The ejection fraction was estimated to be 50%. The culprit lesion was thought to be a small distal PDA. It was felt to be about 80% narrowed. Given the location of this lesion and the size of the vessel, this was not felt to be amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention."
1242,PDA,posterior descending artery,She was suspicious of having unstable angina pectoris. She underwent a repeat cardiac catheterization which showed patent stent in the right coronary with 20% proximal narrowing and 60-70% narrowing of PDA branch. There was a patent stent in both the LAD and diagonal. Circumflex had a 60% narrowing in the proximal portion of the vessel.
1243,PDA,patent ductus arteriosus,"Hemoglobin 7.2 and hematocrit of 21.8 prior to transfusion on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_ and subsequently 12 and 33.9. Results of echocardiogram done on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_ showed small muscular VSD and a small PDA. Repeat echocardiogram on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_ showed a tiny PDA, small PFO, otherwise normal. HOSPITAL COURSE: This patient was transferred to Fairview Ridges Hospital at approximately 10 days' of age with resolving respiratory distress syndrome in a very premature infant."
1244,PDA,posterior descending artery,"The patient had stenting and angioplasty, stenting to the left anterior descending. He had a 60-70% first diagonal lesion, 60-70% OM-1, 80% OM-2 and the PDA was stented as well as the left dominant system. I will plan on taking the patient emergently to the heart catheterization, coronary angiogram and coronary intervention."
1245,PDA,posterior descending artery,"Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ was then consulted for emergent CAB. He underwent a 6-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting on _%#DDMM2007#%_ with a LIMA to his LAD, saphenous vein graft to his D2, D1 and OM, saphenous vein graft to his PDA and posterolateral right. He tolerated the procedure fair. He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit. An intraaortic balloon pump remained in. The patient progressed slowly with the need of inotropes for blood pressure control and low urine output."
1246,PDA,posterior descending artery,SUMMARY: _%#NAME#%_ is a 2-week-old infant who had pulmonary stenosis with intact ventricular septum. His echocardiogram prior to discharge revealed 1-mm residual PDA with left-to-right shunting and good flow across the right ventricular outflow tract with a 45-mm gradient. It was a pleasure being involved in _%#NAME#%_'s care. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.
1247,PDA,posterior descending artery,"He underwent a three-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting x4. LIMA to his LAD, saphenous vein graft to the PLA, sequential to his PDA, saphenous vein graft to his OM. He had tolerated the procedure fine and was transferred to the ICU in stable condition where the patient's postop course was complicated by an episode of atrial fibrillation, treated with amiodarone."
1248,PDA,posterior descending artery,She returned with chest discomfort about two weeks later and underwent repeat heart catheterization . This demonstrated no lesion greater than 40% in the left system and a 70-75% area of stenosis in the PDA. The mid-right coronary artery had a 50% stenosis but the stent site was widely patent. The area of stenosis in the posterior descending artery was noted to be difficult with regard to possible coronary intervention.
1249,PDA,posterior descending artery,There were mild luminal irregularities throughout the LAD. A myocardial bridge was present in the mid-LAD. The left circumflex and marginal branches were free of disease. The previously stented areas of the RCA and PDA were free of significant restenosis. There was 30% stenosis of the ostium of the PDA. A left ventricular gram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% with no evidence of hypokinesis.

Items of interest include, ""I think about killing myself but I would not do it,"" ""I don't like myself"" and ""I'm not sure if anybody loves me."" The RCMAS resulted in clinically significant levels for total anxiety, physiological anxiety, worry/oversensitivity, and social concerns."
1360,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,"LABORATORY DATA: MRIs show herniated and ruptured disc in her neck and low back. These reports are not currently available in my current charting for specific commenting on them, but are available through CDI, where she has had these studies. Venipuncture was taken for hemoglobin, CBC, platelet count, urinalysis with microcoagulation and electrolytes."
1361,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"These individuals tend to have difficulty developing secure relationships with others as well. The CDI suggested a clinically significant level for ineffectiveness and negative self esteem. Items of interest include, ""I want to kill myself,"" although he did note that he was wavering between the items ""I think about killing myself but I would not do it"" and ""I want to kill myself."" Although he has had recent suicidal ideation, as stated earlier, he does not have any plan to do so."
1362,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"In consulting with hospital staff who have communicated with the family, the family has also expressed concern about _%#NAME#%_'s heightened activity level and difficulty focusing for quite some time.

1363,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,We will have physical therapy see the patient for ambulation. Will have Dr. _%#NAME#%_ see her tomorrow. Will obtain records from Suburban Imaging and CDI. Will check postvoid residual and place a Foley if needed. We will start some Senokot and Colace. Ultimately the plan will be to get her symptoms controlled and have her continue this evaluation and treatment as an outpatient.
1364,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,"She does relate that she is not sure what makes it worse or what makes it better other than the narcotics making it better. She denies any weakness to her right leg. Past treatments have been chiropractic physical therapy, epidural steroid injections at CDI in _%#CITY#%_, stretches, Icy-Hot patches and Biofreeze. She states that she has tried the regimen of exercise and stretching, and it does not get any better."
1365,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"Social, emotional, and behavioral functioning: _%#NAME#%_'s social, emotional and behavioral functioning were assessed using self-rating scales, a projective measure, and a non-standardized child-based assessment. Results from the CDI, which is a self-rating scale designed to assess for symptoms of depression in children, reflect a clinically significant level of depression in comparison to other boys _%#NAME#%_'s age."
1366,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,"These findings were discussed with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ at that time and we decided to proceed with an MR spectroscopy to help distinguish between recurrent tumor versus radiation necrosis. This was performed on _%#MMDD2002#%_ at CDI and that showed that the left occipital lesion was primarily necrosis. The left putamen/frontal lesion had central necrosis with peripheral tumor so both tumor and necrosis, and the right medial frontal/corpus callosum lesion showed increased choline consistent with residual tumor and a small amount of necrosis."
1367,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"_%#NAME#%_ was started on Paxil medication (20 mg q.h.s.) when admitted to the hospital to address her anxiety and irritability and has reported positive effects from the medication. She has no known drug allergies.

BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS: _%#NAME#%_ was evaluated over two separate testing sessions at the adolescent day treatment unit at University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview."
1368,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"These individuals also tend to have difficulty in school, possibly due to conflict or emoti onal constraints. The CDI is a self-rating measure for various aspects of depressive- related symptoms. His total CDI score, as well as negative mood and ineffectiveness, were at a clinically significant level. The Rorschach Ink Blot Test was administered on _%#MMDD2005#%_. He had 14 responses, which resulted in a valid and interpretable protocol."
1369,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"He has had fleeting suicidal ideation. There is no evidence of hallucinations, delusions, paranoid ideation, grossly inappropriate affect, or other frank manifestation of psychotic disorder. He is oriented to person, place, and time. TESTS ADMINISTERED AND TASKS COMPLETED: Diagnostic interview, review of medical record, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory - Adolescent (MMPI-A), Rorschach Inkblot Test, Children Depression Inventory (CDI), Revised Children Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). TEST RESULTS: The MMPI-A was responded to in an open and honest manner and the profile is valid and interpretable."
1370,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"In addition their coping mechanisms are somewhat immature. Based on this protocol, a psychotic process cannot be ruled out. The CDI resulted in a clinically significant level for interpersonal problems, ineffectiveness, anhedonia, and negative self-esteem. Items of interest include ""I think about killing myself, but I would not do it."" ""I hate myself."" ""I am bad many times."" ""I feel lonely at times."" He also noted, ""I look ugly,"" and ""I am tired all the time."" The RCM resulted in highly clinically significant levels for physiological anxiety, worry/over- sensitivity, and s ocial concerns/concentration."
1371,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING: _%#NAME#%_'s psychological functioning was assessed using self-rating scale, a sentence completion test (SCT), a projective measure (RATC) and a clinical interview. Results from a self-report measure entitled the CDI, reflected an overall score within the average range. As such, results indicate that _%#NAME#%_ did not endorse a higher than typical number of items associated with depression for an individual his age and gender."
1372,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,"He has been seen by a neurologist for evaluation of his stroke. The MRI scan also shows a left C4-5 disc osteophyte formation, but this is a CDI outside scan and is not available at this point. ALLERGIES: None. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypercholesterolemia. 2. Status post MI with stents."
1373,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above. FAMILY HISTORY: Both parents are in good health. Grandfather possibly with Crohn's disease. SOCIAL HISTORY: Works for CDI. Married. Two children. Occasional caffeine. Minimal alcohol. No smoking. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As above and otherwise negative.
1374,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"On the CDI, _%#NAME#%_ was quite cooperative initially and then refused to complete the 2nd page. It appeared as though she became overwhelmed. _%#NAME#%_ endorsed items on the CDI indicating that she feels sad many times, feels nothing ""at home"" is fun at all, worries that bad things will happen to her, hates herself and thinks about killing herself but would not do it."
1375,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"She is oriented to person, place, and time. TESTS ADMINISTRATION AND TASK COMPLETED: Diagnostic interview, review of medical record, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory - Adolescent (MMPI-A), Rorschach inkblot test, Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), Revised Children ManifestAnxiety Scale (RCMAS). TEST RESULTS: The MMPI-A was responded to in a cautious manner, although the profile was valid and interpretable."
1376,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"At times these individuals also tend to have poor coping mechanisms. The CDI results in clinically significant levels for negative mood, ineffectiveness, anhedonia, and negative self-esteem. Items of interest include: ""I want to kill myself."" ""I do not like myself."" ""I am sad all the time."" ""I do not want to be with people at all."" The RCMAS resulted in clinically significant levels for physiological anxiety and mildly clinically significant levels for worry/oversensitivity and social concern/concentration."
1377,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,She was mildly nauseated but has not vomited. She has had normal bowel and bladder habits. She has felt slightly feverish but has not taken her own temperature. The CT scan done as an outpatient at CDI _%#CITY#%_ _%#CITY#%_ facility is consistent with acute appendicitis. She has subsequently been sent here to Fairview Southdale Hospital for operative care.
1378,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING: _%#NAME#%_'s psychological functioning was assessed using self-rating scales, a sentence completion test (SCT), and a clinical interview. Results from the CDI, which is a rating scale designed to assess for symptoms of depression in younger people, reflect an overall score within the clinically significant range."
1379,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"However, she did complete significant portions of the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Therefore, some perceptions regarding her levels of depression and anxiety were gathered. On the CDI, _%#NAME#%_ was quite cooperative initially and then refused to complete the 2nd page. It appeared as though she became overwhelmed. _%#NAME#%_ endorsed items on the CDI indicating that she feels sad many times, feels nothing ""at home"" is fun at all, worries that bad things will happen to her, hates herself and thinks about killing herself but would not do it."
1380,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"TEST RESULTS: Results from the CDI, which is a self report measure designed to assess for symptoms of depression in children and adolescence, reflects an overall score within the lower average range, indicating that _%#NAME#%_ perceives himself as experiencing less symptoms of depression than the majority of other males his age. All subcutaneous-scales of the CDI were within the normal range. _%#NAME#%_ did endorse items indicating that he worries about aches and pains many times, and is tired many days."
1381,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,He had some chest pain with his exercise but he did not have any ischemic changes on EKG or echocardiogram. His echocardiogram showed normal LV function at that time. The patient had further workup at CDI. He recalls being told that his other studies were also normal. I do not have those results available. He has continued to have dyspnea but it has not changed over these couple of years.
1382,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"These individuals also tend to have superficial relationships with others and tend to believe that their relationships are more secure than they truly are. The CDI and the RCMAS did not result in clinically significant levels for depressive and anxiety symptoms respectively. Once again, due to the high face validity of these measures it is likely that this individual was easily able to maintain his defensiveness in his responses to these items."
1383,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"In addition, they appear to have a somewhat depressed personality. This CDI resulted in clinically significant levels for total CDI score, ineffectiveness, and anhedonia. Negative mood was at a borderline clinically significant level. Items of interest include ""I do many things wrong, I do not like myself, I feel alone many times, and I have to push myself all the time to do my schoolwork."" The RCMAS resulted in highly clinically significant levels for total anxiety, physiological anxiety, and social concerns, as well as concentration difficulties."
1384,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"Concerns regarding symptoms of depression also appeared evident in this assessment due to _%#NAME#%_'s restricted affect, and responses to particular items on the CDI. _%#NAME#%_ also appeared extremely uncomfortable discussing personal and/or family struggles. _%#NAME#%_'s recent increase in behavioral difficulties is also likely related to depression."
1385,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,"He reports progressive onset of acute back pain that was unresponsive to p.o. narcotics. He was started on morphine PCA overnight and was tapered in the morning. His MRI records from CDI were unavailable, as they were closed over the weekend. He was admitted on an early Saturday morning. He was placed on bed rest for day one and then his activities were increased ad lib."
1386,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL FUNCTIONING: _%#NAME#%_'s functioning in these areas was assessed using several self-rating scales (in which the evaluator helped him), a sentence completion test, a projective measure and a clinical interview. _%#NAME#%_ was given the CDI, which is a self-rating scale designed to assess symptoms of depression in children and adolescents. He obtained an overall score within the clinically significant range."
1387,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. _%#NAME#%_ is an 84-year-old female. She has a history of degenerative disc disease and spinal arthritis. She was referred to CDI for an epidural steroid injection. She had a right L2- 3 translaminar epidural on _%#MMDD2006#%_. She had complete relief of pain with no complications documented.
1388,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,"There is also less likelihood for depressive and anxiety-related symptoms. In addition, all the scales are within normal limits. The CDI did not result in any clinically significant level for depressive symptoms; although she had a mild elevation, negative mood, and ineffectiveness."
1389,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,She was admitted through the Emergency Room this early afternoon of _%#MMDD2003#%_ because of stress study. She had seen Dr. _%#NAME#%_ at CDI who had been evaluating her for vascular disease. I do not have the results of all these tests but for all that she attempted a stress nuclear study this morning.
1390,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"Finally, in regard to mood and behavior, results from an assessment of _%#NAME#%_'s functioning in these areas are consistent with diagnoses of depressive disorder, not otherwise specified, as _%#NAME#%_ endorsed a number of items on the CDI consistent with childhood depression. It was also documented in his file at the hospital that he is exhibiting a number of characteristics and symptoms of depression."
1391,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,"The EXTREMITIES are free of edema. He has good pedal pulses. LABORATORY DATA: CT done at CDI is as noted; a copy will be included in his chart. His initial WBC was 13,400 on the _%#DD#%_; it dropped to 8,600 on the _%#DD#%_."
1392,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,"Also consider infectious etiology versus medication induced, which seems unlikely. We will check her stools for infectious etiology and leukocytes. Will also check hepatitis serologies. Will request a CT from CDI in _%#CITY#%_ _%#CITY#%_ to obtain any details regarding her recent ""colitis."" Will also review her recent CT done yesterday to see if the small bowel wall thickening can be reached with an endoscope."
1393,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"There was no evidence of hallucinations, delusions, paranoid ideation, grossly inappropriate affect, or other frank manifestation of psychotic disorder. He was oriented to person, place, and time.

MRI of the lumbosacral spine performed at CDI on _%#MMDD2005#%_ showed a 12 mm intradural nodular mass within the posterior thecal sac at L1 with displacement or mass effect on the tip of the conus medullaris.
1395,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,"He tells me that he was on Vicodin at home and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories that he just felt did not agree with him. He has had an MRI of his lumbar spine done with a report in the chart _%#MMDD2006#%_ from CDI. Moderate to advanced lumbar degenerative disk disease is noted. There is moderate facet hypertrophy in the upper lumbar segments and central restenosis bilaterally at L3-4 of a mild degree, mild to moderate at L2-L3."
1396,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"_%#NAME#%_ also endorsed items indicating that it is difficult for him to keep his mind on his schoolwork, he wiggles a lot in his seat, feels nervous, and often worries about bad things happening to him. Results from the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) reflected an overall score within the non-clinically significant range (T=49). _%#NAME#%_'s subscale scores were also average for his age, indicating that _%#NAME#%_ is not experiencing a clinically significant level of depressive symptoms in comparison to other boys his age."
1397,CDI,center for diagnostic imaging,"3. Prenatal multivitamin daily. 4. Tylenol p.r.n.

This had shown a questionable polyp and to this end we are seeing her. She states that she has a longstanding history of irritable bowel."
1399,CDI,Children's Depression Inventory,"These individuals tend to be highly impulsive and may not understand the consequences of their actions. The CDI was administered on _%#MMDD2005#%_. She rated herself at a clinically significant level for total CDI score, negative mood, and anhedonia."
1400,OR,operating room,"On the day of admission, the patient underwent a colonoscopy by myself, which revealed a nonobstructing, but near obstructing mass at 15 cm consistent with a cancer. The patient was taken to the OR later that day and underwent exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ and a low anterior resection with myself. She had a 1300 cc blood loss but was stable postoperatively."

I would avoid Toradol in this patient who is greater than 60 years of age."
1402,OR,operating room,"The vascular surgery service evaluated him, but because of his connection with an outside surgeon, an eminent followup appointment was done. They have not planned to take him to the OR. Finally, this patient had a pain consultation for this admission to assist with management of pain from his right hand finger lesions and also pain due to a sacral ulcer."
1403,OR,operating room,"The patient had 400 cc blood loss intraoperative and another 400 cc following the delivery. The placenta was adherent to the left fundal region.

1702,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"His admission lab work was significant for an ionized calcium of 6.6 and creatinine of 2.41. HOSPITAL COURSE: PROBLEM #1: Multiple myeloma. Given his relapsed disease, we opted to start him on his first cycle of VAD (vincristine, adriamycin and dexamethasone). Prior to the initiation of chemotherapy, he had a MUGA, which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 59.9%. He tolerated the chemotherapy well."
1703,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,During the workup he was found to have also plasmocells replacing partially his bone marrow. Upon the diagnosis he was treated with radiation therapy to cervical spine and after that he received four cycles of VAD chemotherapy. He developed myopathy while on the Decadron and also had some mild peripheral neuropathy due to vincristine. He did well until _%#MM#%_ when he presented with progressive blindness.
1704,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"His IgG level was 4593. He had an M-protein level of 4.7. His beta 2 microglobulin level was 4.78. His creatinine 1.5.

The patient then received three cycles of VAD consolidation chemotherapy. This was complicated by steroid induced diabetes mellitus for which the patient received insulin, but which resolved, and the patient has been off of insulin for about two weeks."
1707,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Multiple myeloma. PROCEDURES: Infusion VAD chemotherapy. Specifically, that included vincristine 0.4 mg/m2, for an individual dose of 0.5 mg/day as a continuous IV infusion over 96 hours for a total dose of 2 mg. Also included was Adriamycin 10 mg/m squared for an individual dose of 20 mg/day by continuous IV infusion over 96 hours for a total cycle dose of 80 mg."

She was treated with VAD times 4 with minimal response and then was changed to high-dose Cytoxan which resulted in a good response. On _%#MM2003#%_, she underwent autologous bone marrow transplant. Conditioning consisted of 990 cGy total body radiation with Cytoxan."
1709,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,Bone marrow biopsy at that time showed 60% plasma cells. IgG at that time was elevated to 2760 mg/dl with a monoclonal protein spike of 2.3 gm/dl. The patient received VAD chemotherapy for four cycles and tolerated the therapy well although she had two upper respiratory infections during treatment.
1710,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"_%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a very pleasant 67-year-old gentleman with multiple myeloma.

The patient did well during this hospitalization for VAD chemotherapy."
1713,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"She was found to have hemoglobin of 6.6 and an elevated M-spike. Bone marrow biopsy revealed 20% plasma cells. Ms. _%#NAME#%_ was treated with VAD chemotherapy. She received 4 cycles and had an improved M spike. In _%#MM1999#%_ Ms. _%#NAME#%_ underwent an autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview."
1714,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,The patient was treated with VAD for four cycles. The patient is now status post autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant on _%#MMDD2002#%_. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. The patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma IgG in _%#MM#%_ of 2001. The patient received VAD chemotherapy times four cycles with good response.

1715,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"Bone marrow biopsy show aggregates of plasma cells. LDH was twice normal and IgG was 1.7 gm/dl. The patient was treated with VAD for four cycles with good response and the IgG decreased to 0.4 gm/dl. Chemotherapy was complicated with some fatigue and possible leg weakness and edema, as well as hyperglycemia."
1716,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"She did have an ultrasound during this hospitalization which showed a normal concordantly grown twin pregnancy, size appropriate for dates. The patient additionally underwent a GI consultation during this hospitalization. They made a recommendation for the VAD (vincristine, Adriamycin, dexamethasone) protocol but the patient declined this intervention. They had no further recommendations at this time. _%#NAME#%_ was ultimately discharged to home on _%#MMDD2002#%_."
1717,VAD,vincristine adriamycin and dexamethasone,"No protein spike was seen. The patient had mild proteinuria. He was diagnosed as nonsecreting myeloma.

There is a 0.5-1% risk of miscarriage associated with this procedure.
1790,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"Both the chorionic villi sampling (CVS) procedure and the amniocentesis procedure were discussed as the only means of definitely diagnosing a numerical chromosome abnormality in a pregnancy. Both procedures allow for direct fetal chromosomal analysis with 99% accuracy. CVS is offered at 11-13 weeks' gestation and amniocentesis is offered after 15 weeks' gestation. Due to their invasive nature, CVS is associated with a 1:200 (0.5%) to 1:100 (1.0%) risk of miscarriage and amniocentesis is nationally associated with a 1:200 (0.5%) risk of miscarriage."
1791,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"Both the chorionic villi sampling (CVS) procedure and the amniocentesis procedure were discussed as the only way to definitively diagnose a numerical chromosome abnormality in a pregnancy. Both of these procedures allows for direct fetal chromosome analysis with 99% accuracy. CVS is offered at 11-13 weeks gestation and amniocentesis is offered after 15 weeks gestation. It was explained to Antoinette because of the invasive nature of prenatal testing options, they are associated with a risk of miscarriage."

1797,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,"Prenatal testing that is available includes chorionic villous sampling between 10-12 weeks gestation and amniocentesis around 16 weeks gestation. Both CVS and amniocentesis carry a risk of miscarriage of 1:200. In addition, prenatal screening that is available to the patient currently includes first trimester screening."
1798,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,Markers are seen in approximately 50-60% of babies with Down syndrome and approximately 80-90% of babies with the more severe trisomy 13 and 18. Both the chorionic villi sampling (CVS) procedure and the amniocentesis procedure were discussed as the only means of definitely diagnosing a numerical chromosome abnormality in a pregnancy.
1799,CVS,chorionic villus sampling,I reviewed chorionic villa sampling as this patient desired to have this procedure as it is offered earlier in gestation given this is an unexpected pregnancy. Rose has not shared knowledge of her pregnancy with many individuals. CVS is diagnostic for chromosome abnormalities with greater than 99% accuracy. The risk of miscarriage is 1%. We reviewed the 1 to 2% risk of ambiguous results and the less than 1:3000 risk for limb abnormalities.
1800,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"We will obtain serial hemoglobins. We will transfer her for a hemoglobin of 9. Given her ascites and her bleed, she will need 7 days of a fluoroquinolone for SBP prophylaxis. She will receive vitamin K. We will obtain a followup INR. No NSAIDs, heparin products or aspirin product, an order will be put in place."
1801,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"Hemoglobin was 9.7 down from 11 on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_. Platelets were 73,000, creatinine 1.7. His ammonia was 44. HOSPITAL COURSE: Because of his weakness and fever, he was suspected to have SBP. Blood cultures were obtained and he was empirically started on Unasyn. Because of anemia, he was transfused with 2 units of packed red cells."
1802,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"As such, given her abdominal pain, she was started on empiric treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. She remained afebrile throughout the duration of the hospitalization, and will be continued on oral empiric antibiotics for a total of five more days after discharge, to be followed by weekly Cipro for SBP prophylaxis. The patient was never significantly encephalopathic during this hospitalization, she will continue on outpatient lactulose as previously, for a goal number of bowel movements of four per day."
1803,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,Blood cultures and peritoneal fluid cultures showed no growth. The patient was given narcotics for abdominal pain control. His pain improved considerably by the time of discharge. He was sent home on levofloxacin to complete a 10-day course for SBP and he was also given a prescription for ciprofloxacin 750 mg to be taken every week for SBP prophylaxis. PROBLEM #2: Hypokalemia: The patient's diuretics i.e. furosemide was held.

The patient has had ascites present, which was drained at the time when the patient had the G-tube placement and then was also drained later on as well. About three and a half liters were taken off. There was no evidence of any SBP pres ent. The patient though has been started off on SBP prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin 750 mg p.o. or G-tube q.weekly. The patient will continue on this."
1809,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"She was originally diagnosed with primary biliary cirrhosis in 2002. She has had a waxing and waning course involving encephalopathy, as well as SBP and chronic renal insufficiency secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. She had a history of intractable ascites that was requiring frequent paracentesis."
1810,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"No recent other intervention has been in order. He had been evaluated at Mayo Clinic in the past. He has apparently also had treatment at Ridges. His course with the liver problem has been complicated SBP In talking to him today on review of systems, he denies to me that he is short of breath."
1811,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,3. End-stage liver disease with recurrent ascites. PROCEDURES PERFORMED DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION: Bedside paracentesis done on _%#MMDD2007#%_ with removal of 2.2 liters of ascites. CONSULTS OBTAINED DURING THIS ADMISSION: GI Transplant Service. BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 24-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis secondary to congenital hepatitis B with recurrent SBP and history of a recent Klebsiella UTI who was admitted from clinic with low magnesium and potassium. The patient has been admitted multiple times in the past due to this concern as he does have chronic diarrhea and loses his electrolytes through this manner.
1812,SBP,systolic blood pressure,3. Tobacco abuse. Patient will be encouraged to quit smoking. 4. Possible hypertension. The patient's blood pressures will be monitored. She will be placed on treatment for accelerated hypertension if her SBP is greater than 220.
1813,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"A diagnostic paracentesis was performed which revealed 146 nucleated cells, most of which were neutrophils. This did not meet criteria for SBP, however, the patient had been treated with Unasyn at outside hospital so it was felt that it was possible that the patient may have a partially treated SBP."
1814,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"PROBLEM #4: ID. The patient's initial peritoneal cultures from _%#MMDD#%_, obtained from Interventional Radiology revealed a negative gram stain as well as culture. However, the PMNN count was consistent with SBP. The patient was thus initially started on vancomycin and cefotax, which was changed out to Unasyn. She received a 10-day course of IV antibiotics, which finished on _%#MM2004#%_."
1815,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"1. Recurrent ascites requiring repeat paracentesis, currently stable. 2. Varicose vein surgery. 3. Tubal ligation. 4. Anemia of chronic disease. 5. Recurrent urinary tract infection (VRE). 6. Hypothyroidism (on replacement therapy). 7. SBP prophylaxis (currently on rifaximin and ciprofloxacin weekly). 8. Hepatic encephalopathy (currently stable on low-dose lactulose). Her last serum ammonia level was 12, at the time of hospital admission."
1816,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"She had multiple imaging studies during her hospital stay. Her most recent abdominal CT on _%#MMDD2003#%_ showed unremarkable liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands. There was a moderate amount of ascites, which had been tapped and was negative for SBP. Kidneys were normal except for extra-renal pelvis on the left. There was some mild sludge in her gallbladder. There was no abdominal wall thickening or dilatation of the small or large bowel."
1817,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. _%#NAME#%_ is a 58-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use. The patient's liver disease has been complicated by history of SBP, recurrent ascites requiring large volume paracentesis, hepatic encephalopathy, grade 3 esophageal varices found on EGD, and renal insufficiency. The patient was recently discharged from the hospital last week."
1818,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"He receives hemodialysis through a tunneled Hickman three times a week. 2. End-stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C, with a history of SBP. He was considered not a TIPS candidate secondary to his renal disease. 3. Diabetes mellitus secondary to prednisone. 4. History of DVT, status post IVC filter placement."
1819,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"We did send the patient down for an ultrasound guided tap by Interventional Radiology, but they also thought that there was not enough fluid and with his dilated bowel, that it would be too risky procedure. We subsequently decided that we should treat him empirically for possible SBP or secondary peritonitis and we chose ceftriaxone. We then discharged the patient on levofloxacin with dosing for his renal insufficiency."
1820,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"The patient remained in the ICU for approximately six days, slowly recovering. On admission, an abdominal ultrasound was obtained to evaluate for ascites to rule out SBP as a possible cause of his presentation. There was no ascites present. The patient was also empirically treated with antibiotics for possible pneumonia as well."
1821,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"5. Hypothyroidism: -She is currently on replacement therapy. 6. Gastrointestinal prophylaxis: -She is on Protonix 40 mg b.i.d. 7. Depressed mood: -She is on Zyprexa 2.5 mg daily. 8. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis: -She is on ciprofloxacin once weekly, held on admit. 9. Malnutrition: -Will keep NPO tonite -She is currently on a soft diet with supplements."
1822,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"She certainly does have gallstones, but given her clinical history and her physical findings, I think it is more likely that peritoneal infection is the likely cause of her current symptoms. PLAN: We certainly need to keep a close eye on her symptoms, and as her SBP treatment progresses, I can certainly evaluate if she has ongoing issues related to her right upper quadrant. I explained all of these issues to the patient, as she appears to understand well, and is in agreement with our plan to follow her symptomatology."
1823,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"The patient had 2 episodes of paracentesis most recently on _%#MMDD2007#%_. Viral hepatitis serology is negative. He underwent diagnostic paracentesis, initially followed by therapeutic paracentesis, no SBP presently. The patient is on Cipro for prophylaxis for SBP. Mr. _%#NAME#%_ is also on Lasix and Aldactone. He may need repeat paracentesis in the future as ascitic fluid builds up."
1824,SBP,systolic blood pressure,"9. Percocet 1 to 2 tab p.o. q4-6h p.r.n. 10. Rocephin 1 g IV q12h. 11. Labetalol 10 to 40 mg IV q2h p.r.n. for SBP greater than 140. 12. Hydralazine10 to 40mg IV q2h p.r.n. for SBP greater than 140. 13. Zofran 48 mg IV q6h p.r.n. nausea. 14. Oxygen per nasal cannula. 15. Ativan 2 mg IV x1 p.r.n. for general tonic clonic seizures, or two or more complex partial seizures in 3 hours."
1825,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"2. Hepatic encephalopathy, likely multifactorial: Recent urinary infection and now worsening hyponatremia are likely contributing factors. There is no evidence of SBP at the outside hospital. At this time, recommendation is to continue with lactulose aggressively to have 5-6 bowel movements, continue with rifaximin and Zinc sulfate (this was started while patient was in the hospital 2 days back), and correction of electrolytes."
1826,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"Patient is passing gas so this is not complete. No prior abd surgeries that I'm aware of to predispose, we will have to find out if he has had colonoscopy yet. 2. SBP: borderline criteria by PMNs in ascites, will treat with ceftriaxone while cultures pending 3. hyperkalemia: check ECG, plan for kayexelate. If truly obstructed will need to use non-GI measures to reduce."
1827,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Since time of admission, the patient did say that he had increasing abdominal distention and also had abdominal pain as well. This time, it was suspected that the patient possibly might have SBP. The patient received paracentesis and his fluid was sent for cultures and also for fluid analysis as well. His fluid analysis revealed that he had RBC count of 2960, nucleated cells were 69, neutrophils were 6, lymphocytes 21, monocytes were 73 and the fluid was yellow and hazy."
1828,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"He also has associated coagulopathy. There may be a nutrition component, but I suspect this is solely related to his liver disease. He does not have renal failure and there appears to be no evidence for SBP, though he has been bleeding; he may have some degree of ascites and it may be prudent to have him on a fluoroquinolone for SBP prophylaxis."
1829,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"1. This is a 40-year-old end-stage liver failure patient with subacute hepatic encephalopathy in the setting of hyponatremia, with a recent paracentesis without evidence of SBP. 2. Persistent mild leukocytosis with left shift, cannot rule out remote but possible bacteremia. PLAN: We will fully culture this man with blood cultures x2, UA, UC, and do a chest x-ray."
1830,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"Her chest x-ray has been ordered and is pending. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a 47-year-old female with end-stage liver disease secondary to alcohol abuse and refractory ascites presenting with hyponatremia, confusion, and weakness with normal ammonia levels and no signs of SBP on clinical exam. 1. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium at 123 likely secondary to her diuretics that have been held in her last doctor visit."
1831,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,BUN to creatinine ratio is difficult to assess with expected contribution from upper GI bleed. Bilateral renal ultrasound has been requested to consider hydronephrosis. FENA has been requested to confirm presumed prerenal etiology. 5. SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) prophylaxis: As this patient likely has variceal bleeding in a setting of cirrhosis SBP prophylaxis will be offered with levofloxacin.
1832,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,2. Autoimmune hepatitis followed by Dr. _%#NAME#%_; last seen in _%#MM#%_; currently on Imuran and prednisone.

Ciprofloxacin 750 mg p.o. q. week for SBP prophylaxis. FOLLOWUP: The patient is being set up for a TIPS procedure in interventional radiologist on Friday _%#MMDD2007#%_ at 8:00 a.m. He will be discharged home until that time and likely be readmitted following the procedure for observation and follow up ultrasound.
1834,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"Please see the admission H&P for further information of the patient's presenting symptoms, past medical history, family history, social history and admission physical exam. HOSPITAL COURSE: PROBLEM #1: Probable SBP. The patient has a history of recurrent SBP and is on prophylactic medicines. MMedications at home, j Just prior to this admission, he had been on leave levofloxacin 750 mg p.o. weekly."
1835,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,The patient needs to be seen by Chemical Dependency also as he minimally fulfilled the criteria for listing (he is sober for 6 months). RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Nephrology consult. 2. Urinalysis and FENa. 3. Diagnostic paracentesis to rule out SBP. 4. IV fluids plus albumin. 5. No diuretics. 6. Will follow the MELD labs. 7. Will discuss him in Transplant meeting and try to expedite his listing on the transplant.
1836,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"As far as the elevated ammonia levels, I would discontinue the lactulose as you have and begin Rifaximin as already currently being treated. Would do a diagnostic paracentesis to rule out SBP. 2. Hyponatremia likely secondary to end-stage liver disease: Would continue treating as you are with restricted free water. Continue to monitor closely. 3. Hypokalemia likely secondary to large bowel movements and Lasix: Continue to aggressively replace potassium per protocol as you are."
1837,SBP,systolic blood pressure,"Today, the patient became completely unresponsive in a whirlpool bath where it was witnessed that his eyes rolled back. At that time, no seizure activity was witnessed. SBP was in the 90's and O2 sats were 77% on room air. The patient was brought in to F-UMC ER. Vital signs were: blood pressure 103/75, pulse 89, respiratory 16, temperature 99.2, satting 97% on room air."
1838,SBP,systolic blood pressure,I. Acute renal failure. Differential diagnosis includes: A. Pre-renal. 1. Decreased cardiac output due to potential CHF corroborated by elevated BNP. Hold diuretics now. Check TEE for change in LV function. Likely needs better afterload reduction. Aim SBP approximately 100 with nitrate and hydralazine in setting of elevated creatinine. Will consult Cardiology after TEE. 2. Third spacing with decreased intravascular volume.
1839,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"We will continue present management with Glucotrol. Of note, her hemoglobin A1C was last 7.0 on _%#MMDD2003#%_. 5. End-stage liver disease. We will continue her present management with Lasix, spironolactone and ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis. 6. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. These appear chronic and stable from her previous admission."
1840,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics with Zosyn. The patient eventually did undergo diagnostic paracentesis, which was not suggestive of SBP and the cultures did not grow any organisms. The patient was seen by GI, who recommended a full course of treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis."
1841,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"He was also seen by physical, occupational therapy is ambulating well upon discharge. 5. Infectious disease. The patient was treated empirically with antibiotics throughout his hospital stay for SBP prophylaxis. He did have a few low-grade temps several days ago, but these subsequently resolved. Cultures have all been negative. He had some loose stools and C."
1842,SBP,spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,"As such, would recommend that if patient is re-admitted prior to his Neuropsychiatric evaluation would have inpatient team or immediately order a Neuropsychiatry consult in order to evaluation the patient while he is an inpatient to complete his workup. 7. Patient is not a TIPS candidate given his history of frequent hepatic encephalopathy, frequent admissions for confusion, and increased risk for SBP. It has been a pleasure participating in his care. Please contact me at _%#TEL#%_ with any further questions regarding this admission."

PROCEDURES: CT scan chest to rule out PE on _%#DDMM2007#%_ showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus. There seemed to be some patchy bilateral changes. Two nodules, one measuring 3 mm and one measuring 7 mm noted in the right upper lobe."
1917,PE,pulmonary embolus,"The rheumatology service ultimately recommended that Ms. _%#NAME#%_ be discharged on her outpatient regimen of prednisone with the added precaution of not restarting her methotrexate too soon in the postoperative period. Regarding her anticoagulation and history of DVT with PE, Ms. _%#NAME#%_ was started on enoxaparin, and a hematology consult was obtained to further evaluate her anticoagulation status. Their recommendations were to continue her enoxaparin on discharge and for her to follow up with her primary care physician to determine the necessity of continuing with this anticoagulation."
1918,PE,pulmonary embolus,The patient will be taken off of IV antibiotics for his left apical pneumonia and switched to Levaquin and should be continued till _%#DDMM2007#%_. LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGY RESULTS: A chest x-ray done on _%#MMDD#%_ showed unremarkable chest. A CT of the chest on PE protocol on _%#MMDD#%_ showed left lung apex infiltrate and no evidence of pulmonary embolism or vascular calcifications according to the coronary artery.
1919,PE,pulmonary embolus,"No cough, shortness of breath, or history of asthma.No abdominal pain, blood in the stool, black tarry stools, or urinary burning, frequency, or urgency. No history of abnormal bleeding tendencies. No history of DVT or PE. No loss of consciousness, seizure, severe unusual headache, focal numbness or weakness, and no vertigo at this time. The rest of the review of systems is negative except for some flare of eczema."
1920,PE,pulmonary embolus,"Ultrasound on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2003, showed a 4 x 5 x 4-cm left adnexal mass with small to moderate free fluid. Ultrasound on day of admission showed similar. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's medical history is remarkable for a PE in 2002. She was hospitalized in the ICU per patient report for that problem. She had been on the Ortho Evra patch at the time."
1921,PE,pulmonary embolus,"Because the patient had some pleuritic component and some chest pressure with a deep breath, he underwent a CT angiogram to rule out PE, which was negative. However, a pulmonary nodule was seen on this CT scan. The pulmonary team was consulted. There was a question of whether there may be a malignant process, given that the patient also has concomitant voice hoarseness."
1922,PE,pulmonary embolus,"LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm. ABDOMEN: Benign. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema. D-dimer is positive. CT of chest with PE protocol positive for bilateral pulmonary emboli. IMPRESSION: 1. Acute pulmonary embolism. 2. Evidence of right heart strain with hypoxia and hypotension."
1923,PE,pulmonary embolus,The patient did have a VQ scan done during her hospitalization which showed only the defect from the pleural effusion and she had no PE. 4. Episodic congestive heart failure probably due to diastolic dysfunction. Patient had a cardiac echo done on _%#DDMM2002#%_ which showed normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness.
1924,PE,pulmonary embolus,b. Renal failure secondary to chronic renal insufficiency compounded by acute GI bleed. c.

Tympanoplasty. 4. Mastoidectomy. 5. Left foot surgeries. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: GENERAL: The patient denies fevers or weight changes, but does have multiple allergies and is noting shortness of breath and sputum production with cough."
1926,PE,pulmonary embolus,"2. Hypopnea. Initially was felt secondary to narcotics, although her last narcotics was yesterday morning. She was given Narcan x 4 with some equivocal response. She underwent a VQ scan, which was negative for any PE. I suspect that this possibly represents central hypopnea with her central findings. Apparently, her sats are stable, and we will monitor this closely."
1927,PE,pulmonary embolus,"CPK and troponin immediate evaluation expressed an emergent spiral CT of the chest to rule out pulmonary embolus. CK and troponin remained within normal limits. Unfortunately, the spiral CT of the chest disclosed bilateral PE. The patient was started immediately on heparin protocol with great improvement in his shortness of breath. The antibiotics were continued empirically for exacerbation of COPD/pneumonia. The pain in his right lower extremities is much improved as well."
1928,PE,pressure equalization,SURGERIES: 1. She is status post stress incontinence repair times four. 2. Cholecystectomy 3. Bilateral hip repair 4. Hysterectomy 5. Oophorectomy 6.

1929,PE,pulmonary embolus,"It was read as small on recent CT scan. Tapping would be complicated in this patient given that she is on Coumadin for her PE history. Ultimately, if tapping is indicated, would need to reverse her INR with vitamin K, place the patient on heparin, perform the tap, and then restart the Coumadin."
1930,PE,pulmonary embolus,"LABORATORY DATA: He did receive vitamin K 2 mg. His INR still is high as noted. ASSESSMENT: 1. Right shoulder fracture. 2. Possible hip fracture. 3. Chronic Coumadin use due to history of PE, DVT and prior stroke. Certainly he will be at higher risk of clots postop because of this. 4. Chronic right-sided paralysis. PLAN: 1. He should okay for the OR if needed according to Dr. _%#NAME#%_."
1931,PE,pulmonary embolus,The patient wishes to be full code. I believe the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is probably stable and not contributing to his symptoms. He only risk factor for PE is sedentary lifestyle. His d-dimer is falsely elevated. PLAN: For Accelerated hypertension and pulmonary edema with respiratory failure.
1932,PE,pulmonary embolus,"This was followed by subsequent chest x-rays, as she was having persistent chest pain. I was somewhat suspicious that she may have been developing hemothorax or a more complicated course with her PE. Her x-rays, however, were pretty stable and her pain has it has improved quite a bit. At this point, I suspect that she will recover from this uneventfully."
1933,PE,pulmonary embolus,"However, last night he began to develop slowly progressive dyspnea, came back to the Emergency Room and has been readmitted to the hospital. In the Emergency Room the patient had another CT scan of the chest performed to rule out PE, which is negative. In addition, he has had a little bit of questionable double vision and because of this a head CT scan was done without contrast that is also negative aside for an old lacunar infarct."
1934,PE,pulmonary embolus,"HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Shortness of breath and chest pain. In this hospital admission we did the lower extremity Doppler, which was negative for any clots and we also did the CT scan with PE protocol and that was also negative for any clots. That also did not show any infiltrates in his lungs. That did show small bilateral pleural effusions and a 3 mm nodule of uncertain significance."
1935,PE,pulmonary embolus,"The patient had low probability of a PE, had negative bilateral lower extremity Dopplers per our ultrasound lab and also an additional repeat CT with PE protocol which was negative for PE. She did show some bilateral basilar atelectasis which was consistent with previous CTs and x-rays. 3. CV. The patient had negative troponin and no significant ST wave changes, so this is likely not the etiology of her mental status changes."
1936,PE,pulmonary embolus,"The patient states that she does lift weights and was playing tennis last week but does not recall any acute injury to the chest wall and has not seen any chest wall lesions. The patient denies any central chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath. The patient denies history of pneumothorax, PE or DVT. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Epilepsy diagnosed at age 8."
1937,PE,pulmonary embolus,"Urinalysis was negative. Troponin was negative x1. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: CT scan of the chest showed marked bile duct dilation at pancreatic head with no identifiable cause. No evidence of PE or infiltrates. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 72-year-old Laotian male with history of GERD, hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism, who presents with complaints of right upper quadrant pain, nausea and vomiting, who is found to have marked bile duct dilation and increased bilirubin with eosinophilia on laboratory investigation."
1938,PE,pulmonary embolus,"PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. P 3-0-0-3. 2. Diverticulitis. 3. History of colostomy, with reversal in 2000. 4. History of deep venous thrombosis and PE in 2002. 5. Congestive heart failure, _%#DDMM2002#%_. 6. Osteoarthritis. 7. Anemia. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Colostomy, 2000. See complete details of surgeries in the history of the present illness."
1939,PE,pulmonary embolus,"Looking into her old labs, she did have a weak lupus anticoagulant which would put her at risk for a hypercoagulable state. Therefore, we will check a VQ scan to rule PE. In addition, we will check an echocardiogram to ensure that her ejection fraction looks okay. Of note, the patient does have a positive pregnancy test."
1940,PE,pulmonary embolus,"She had several episodes of variable blood sugars and had been to the emergency rooms before that. She had elevated creatinines, therefore a dye was not given for a CT scan, but a V/Q scan showed moderate size perfusion defects in the left lower lobe, in the right upper lobe with a moderate to high probability for PE with a D-dimer that was 1.3. Her initial creatinine was 2.9. Her creatinine gradually improved on to about 1.8. CT scan showed a mass in the head of pancreas about 4 cm."
1941,PE,pulmonary embolus,"She presented here on _%#DDMM2007#%_ with progressive shortness of breath over the last number of week prior to her hospitalization. She was investigated in regards to possible PE that showed not to be the case on CT scan. She was started on heparin prophylaxis and a chest x-ray was thought to suggest pneumonia, for which she was started on antibiotics."
1942,PE,pressure equalization,"She was alert, well hydrated, and in moderate respiratory distress. Her O2 sat was 85 percent. HEENT: Atraumatic, normocephalic. The TMs were clear. The PE tube was in the canal. The right PE tube was in place. PERRLA. Extraocular movements intact. Nasal mucosa was clear. Posterior oropharynx was clear."
1943,PE,pulmonary embolus,The patient did have echocardiogram which showed positive bubble study. This may need to be assessed later on. The patient did have a CT scan of the chest that was negative for PE but which did show a pulmonary nodule which should be followed up in 3-6 months. Overall there are no at risk events on monitor. The patient did have one spell during the stay after her ultrasound where she developed chest pain and had a moment where she did not remember recent conversation that took place.
1944,PE,pulmonary embolus,"That seems to have resolved at this point and she has had again some improvement in the right leg symptoms. She was seen in clinic and was noted to have quite a bit of swelling unilaterally and she was referred for an ultrasound to rule out or rule in DVT as well as a CAT scan due to her complaint of chest pain and dyspnea; both tests were positive for DVT and PE, respectively. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for breast cancer. The patient was initially diagnosed in 1986 with ductal carcinoma in situ of the right breast treated with lumpectomy and radiation in 2004."
1945,PE,pulmonary embolus,"2. Ultrasound of the lower extremities showed occlusive thrombus in the left popliteal vein, bilaterally enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 58-year-old male who was found to have a PE incidentally on a followup CT scan on the day of admit. He has a history of rheumatoid arthritis complicated by pleural effusion and empyema with most recent admission being 2 weeks ago."
1946,PE,pulmonary embolus,"He started chemotherapy in _%#MM#%_ of this year and has been on interferon for the last three weeks. 2. History of DVT, PE. It sounds like he had his diagnosis from having had a CT scan of the chest in _%#MM#%_ of 2005 and they found he had bilateral pulmonary embolus and right popliteal DVT."
1947,PE,pulmonary embolus,"She states that this is not the kind of pain that she had two years ago with her angioplasty but she also readily admits she does not remember what kind of pain she had two years ago. She has no history of pleurisy, pulmonary emboli (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Of note, her medication list does not match up with what one would expect for a patient who has had angioplasty."
1948,PE,pulmonary embolus,"ALT 155, AST 155. EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. No acute ST wave changes. Chest x-ray negative per Emergency Department report, other than cardiomegaly. Chest CT: Negative for PE. It does show bilateral bibasilar atelectasis. ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 1. Acute myocardial infarction. The patient is ruling in for cardiac ischemia."
1949,PE,pulmonary embolus,"The patient was fully sensate and fully functional with his right upper extremity. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's past medical history is significant for: 1. PE in the remote past. 2. Ewing sarcoma, status post excision and chemoradiation. 3. Catheter sepsis."

Pneumonia, unclear etiology, aspiration versus community-acquired pneumonia versus septic type picture secondary to recent abortion and products of conception."

Pediatric Gastroenterology was asked to see the patient once again as they know her quite well. They recommended checking a CEA and AFP, and to have weekly liver function tests and close follow-up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ Sharp. 7. Infectious disease. The patient had intermittent fevers throughout her hospitalization, and a chest x-ray was obtained, and showed a right middle lobe pneumonia."
2408,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"SLEEP: Negative PAIN: He is on Vicodin and Flexeril for his back pain, some oxycodone . LABORATORY DATA: Increase in his CEA but he continues to smoke. CHEMO/RADIATION TREATMENT HISTORY: Last drugs were 5- FU and Leucovorin."
2409,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"Her PAP came back essentially normal; however, she did have endometrial cells present. The patient was also assessed with colonoscopy given her increased CEA at 25.9 and colonoscopy was essentially normal. The patient was taken to the operating room on _%#MMDD2007#%_ for an exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and staging procedure."
2410,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"This revealed hepatocellular carcinoma with extensive necrosis. The tumor cells were positive for many markers consistent with liver cancer. It was negative for CEA monoclonal and polyclonal AFP, EMA. This was signed out as hepatocellular carcinoma. Other laboratory studies of significance show this gentleman to be hepatitis B surface antibody positive."
2411,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"Sleeping well, eating is so-so and weight is down 4 pounds. LABORATORY DATA: Labs show his CEA has gone down slightly to 12.5. Otherwise relatively stable. FAMILY HISTORY/SOCIAL HISTORY: No change. ALLERGIES: To penicillin. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 98/62, pulse 80, respirations 18, temperature 97 and weight 153."
2412,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"He is status post CABG in 1995. 2. Chronic intermittent stable chest pain, possible angina. 3. Ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction 30-35% on previous echo. 4. Peripheral vascular disease, status post right CEA. 5. History of CVA in 1994 and TIA in 2004. 6. Chronic renal insufficiency with creatinines running around 3.0."
2413,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,He started having significant abdominal pain in _%#MM#%_ and finally came in for evaluation this fall. Dr. _%#NAME#%_ found his CEA level was elevated and he was seen by Dr. _%#NAME#%_. Subsequent workup has shown that he has an elevated CEA antigen level.
2414,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"Cytology from the fluid reveals tumor cells; still waiting for the staining. Serum CEA, PSA pending."
2415,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"No small-bowel obstruction was noted. On hospital day#3, the patient's CA-125 had returned to 14. In addition, her TSH had returned at 1 and her CEA returned at 1.1. All of these values were normal."
2416,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"IMMUNE: Negative. PSYCH: Negative. SLEEP: Negative PAIN: Negative. LABORATORY DATA: Lab and CT were normal except his CEA is slightly elevated. His last colonoscopy was _%#MMDD2002#%_ and he is supposed to have one about every three years. FAMILY HISTORY/SOCIAL HISTORY: No change ALLERGIES: No known allergies PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 134/80, pulse 68, respirations 20, temperature 98.2, and weight 190."
2417,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"Following paracentesis, a mass effect was noted in the upper abdomen. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated enlarged cirrhotic liver with nodular margin. A CEA elevated at 27.3 (smoker). EGD pursued on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, demonstrating a varices/portal gastropathy. Exam was suspicious for linitis plastica consistent with diffuse inflammatory adenocarcinoma."
2418,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"She saw Dr. _%#NAME#%_. He wants another CT in 3 months. Her tumor markers which had been going down when she was on treatment have now gone in the last month from CEA of 21.6 to 33.2, and a CA27.29 from 120 to 176. CHEMO/RADIATION TREATMENT HISTORY: Drugs are on hold. She was on Taxotere in the past, Navelbine and then Xeloda, Arimidex."
2419,CEA,carotid endarterectomy,"PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Cerebrovascular disease with bilateral carotid bruits and stenosis noted on last hospitalization, status post right CEA. Status post cataract surgery. Status post left total knee arthroplasty. Status post shoulder surgery _%#MMDD2003#%_. Status post right hip fracture with total hip arthroplasty _%#MM2003#%_."
2420,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"I am pleased to report that _%#NAME#%_ has been a model patient and he has tolerated all of his treatment quite well since _%#MMDD#%_, and he will be completing his adjuvant treatment as of _%#MMDD2004#%_. Throughout this time frame his labs have remained stable. His most recent liver functions were entirely normal, and his last CEA determination on _%#MMDD#%_ was normal at 0.8, we have repeated it today. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: (Unchanged). 1. Lipitor. 2. Coreg. 3. Cozaar."
2421,CEA,carotid endarterectomy,"ASSESSMENT: 1. Pneumonia with chest pain. 2. Arteriosclerotic heart disease with status post coronary artery bypass graft. 3. Peripheral vascular disease, status post left CEA. 4. Hyperlipidemia on treatment. 5. Type II diabetes mellitus. 6. Ischemic cardiomyopathy. PLAN: 1. Will admit the patient and place her on Tequin. We will resume her home medications all except her Coumadin and her Glucophage."
2422,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"Early in the hospitalization, when it was unclear that his mental status change was related to his narcotic use, we did send off tumor markers, including CEA, that did come back marginally elevated at 3. However, in light of his chronic end-stage liver disease and pancreatitis, it is unclear of the relevance of this finding."
2423,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Partial small bowel obstruction with ongoing symptoms. 2. Malnutrition due to poor intake. 3. History of colon cancer with recent negative colonscopy, normal CEA and CA 19-9 without evidence for spread. 4. Recent recurrent breast cancer, status post mastectomy with no evidence for further spread."
2424,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"She will be scheduled to undergo a staging PET scan in 2 or 3 weeks and she may also benefit from a bone scan or a needle biopsy of the left adrenal lesion. A baseline CEA level will be obtained today. Her previous records from Abbott Northwestern Hospital will be obtained regarding her history of polycythemia, especially given her family history of polycythemia in several family members."
2425,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"The patient was transferred to Fairview-University Medical Center secondary to concern for ovarian versus primary peritoneal tumor. The patient was found to have a CA-125 of 376, a normal CEA at 0.2. Chest x-ray was consistent with a right pleural effusion. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a large amount of ascites."
2426,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"He then has been followed by his primary physician in California, and has been doing well until recently when he had an elevated CEA level. This led to a workup, including a PET scan and CT scan, which showed possible adrenal metastasis, with a 3-cm lesion, and a possible mesenteric nodule suspicious for cancer, according to their radiologist."
2427,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"Platelet count 119,000. After transfusion, his hemoglobin was 8.2 on _%#MMDD2005#%_, 8.0 on _%#MMDD2005#%_, and 8.9 yesterday, _%#MMDD2005#%_. No preop or postop CEA level was drawn. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A 57-year-old white male with likely stage 2 (T3N0Mx) adenocarcinoma of the colon (with some high-risk features)."
2428,CEA,carotid endarterectomy,He has no carotid hypersensitivity on exam today. 2. Coronary artery disease with multiple revascularizations. Stable angina pectoris. Normal ejection fraction. 3. Peripheral vascular disease with bilateral claudication and status post bilateral CEA. 4. Diabetes mellitus. RECOMMENDATION: 1. I would change his Norvasc to hs dosing.
2429,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"Abdomen was benign. At today's visit, a CBC was obtained along with liver function studies. If there are any problems, I will call you. Her last CEA was on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2001, and was normal at 1.8. We will see this patient back periodically in the future."
2430,CEA,carotid endarterectomy,"6. Hydrochlorothiazide Dr. _%#NAME#%_ held. 7. Aspirin 81 mg. 8. Protonix 40 mg q. day. 9. Simvastatin 20 mg a day. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Right carotid stent in 1998, left CEA in _%#MM2005#%_, pacemaker in _%#MM2005#%_, cholecystectomy, benign bladder tumor repair and coronary bypass surgery and mitral valve replacement and aortic graft in 2001."
2431,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,I do not have any baseline lab tests other than a hemoglobin of 14.4 with a white count of 5900. She had a chest x-ray that was clear. Electrocardiogram was normal. I do not have liver functions or CEA present. Mrs. _%#NAME#%_ has a Duke's C colon cancer. This is an exceedingly unusual presentation for a small tumor within the villous adenoma that is well differentiated.
2432,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"PSYCHIATRIC: Negative. PAIN: She has some achiness with Neupogen. PAIN MANAGEMENT: Ibuprofen does not work real well. LABS: Her CEA and her CA 27-29 have increased fairly dramatically, basically doubling. The CEA was 106, and now is 203. CA 27-29 was 250, and now is 347. SOCIAL/FAMILY HISTORY: No change. CHEMO & RADIATION THERAPY HISTORY: She has been on Gemzar."
2433,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"He indicates he had a colonoscopy in the last ""couple of years"" and the exam was unremarkable. He had a right hemicolectomy related to his colon surgery. Apparently, he has had a slightly elevated CEA antigen, and for this reason, a CT scan of the abdomen was done. There was a vague 3 cm ill-defined density in the region of the ileocecal anastomosis."
2434,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"She has metastatic colon cancer from _%#MM1999#%_ with a grade 3, stage 3 adenocarcinoma, status post right hemi. She received adjuvant chemotherapy. Her CEA rose. She had omental mets. Port-A-Cath was placed. CAVO chemotherapy was started. CEA began to fall and then started rising again in _%#MM2003#%_. The patient had a reaction to chemotherapy on her last admission."
2435,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,Plans therefore will be addressed regarding both the rectal cancer and the prostate cancer. We will be obtaining a bone scan prior to his discharge and a repeat CEA to see if it is coming down in his new baseline. I will be planning on seeing him in my office following his outpatient visit at the University of Minnesota Radiation Therapy Department to facilitate the oral Xeloda portion of his radiation treatment schedule.
2436,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,STUDIES: Chest x-ray within normal limits. Abdominal x-ray with multiple air fluid levels consistent with partial small bowel obstruction. CEA 1.1 with within normal limits. ASSESSMENT/PLAN: A 57-year-old female with recurrent nonsurgical colon cancer recently receiving chemo who suffers recurrent episode of partial small bowel obstruction possibly secondary to constipation.
2437,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"There are no apparent masses. At today's visit, her hemoglobin was 11.3, white count 4000, platelets were 136,000. On _%#MMDD2006#%_ at your office, she had an ALT of 28 and an AST of 32. The CEA was drawn today and is pending. In considering at this point her various options following surgical resection of an isolated metastasis, there is a paucity of data regarding what to do with patients at this point in time."
2438,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"LABORATORY STUDIES FROM ADMISSION: Showed normal serum electrolytes, BUN is 12, creatinine is 0.7. Liver function studies are normal. CEA on _%#MMDD2002#%_ is 1.2. CBC from _%#MMDD2002#%_ shows a white count of 6900, hemoglobin 12.7, platelet count of 278,000 with a normal differential."
2439,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"EXTREMITIES are unremarkable. ASSESSMENT: Colon cancer, transverse colon. Patient has not been operated. RECOMMENDATION: Proceed to surgery as scheduled. Will check a CBC, platelet count, CEA, liver enzymes, lytes, chest x-ray and EKG."
2440,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,The patient had an a.m. cortisol drawn that next day with thyroid functions which were normal. Urine studies were not consistent with SIADH and the low sodium was presumed secondary to water intoxication. CEA level was normal at 1.9. The patient's sodium level quickly responded and increased to 136. She then contacted me about a week and a half later stating that she felt her appetite was changing some and also felt mildly depressed.
2441,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"The patient subsequently received 6 months of FOLFOX and tolerated fairly well with some mild peripheral neuropathy. Unfortunately, in _%#MM2006#%_, the patient was found to have a rising CEA 3 months after his chemotherapy. Imaging studies revealed an enlarged mesenteric lymph node which was small. PET CT also confirmed the disease progression. The patient at that time was seen by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_."
2442,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"Magnesium level 1.7. Total protein 6.1. Triglyceride level of 75. CA125 was done on _%#MMDD2002#%_. There was also a CEA done which was normal at 1.4. The prealbumin level was mildly low at 14 on _%#MMDD2002#%_, and this is normal at 19 on _%#MMDD2002#%_, probably indicated that her caloric intake is adequate for the nutritional improvement."
2443,CEA,carotid endarterectomy,"Other systems negative. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 36.8, heart rate 61, blood pressure 133/74, respiratory rate 18 and he is in no acute distress. NECK: Supple. No JVD, no carotid bruits. There is a postop scar from right CEA. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. ABDOMEN: Nontender and nondistended. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. There is a mechanical click from his mechanical valve heard."
2444,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"There is no lymphedema. NEUROLOGIC: Cranial nerves II-XII are intact. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient has no evidence on CT scan or physical exam of recurrent disease but his CEA is gradually climbing. I have told both him and his wife that the smoking, even though he has cut back quite dramatically to about 1/2 pack a day, may still be affecting this, and I have written him a prescription for Nicoderm patch, and for Mycostatin powder."
2445,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"The patient had a CT scan in the emergency room which suggested possible pancreatic malignancy in the head of the pancreas and, therefore, he was admitted. MRI was obtained which confirmed the suspicion of pancreatic malignancy. CA99, as well as CEA tumor marker was still pending. The patient's liver function tests were unremarkable during this hospitalization, but his INR was supratherapeutic on a low dose of Coumadin."
2446,CEA,carotid endarterectomy,"PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease, status post two-vessel CABG in 1981 (incomplete revascularization). 2. Peripheral artery disease, status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, status post bilateral CEA. 3. Ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30% in _%#MM2005#%_. 4. Lung cancer, status post resection. 5. Colon cancer. ALLERGIES: No known allergies."
2447,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"The obstipation was thought related perhaps to high-dose diltiazem for her congestive heart failure, but because of a 70-pound weight loss they are planning to continue their workup for malignancy. Other part of her workup while was she in included laboratory studies that did show a slightly elevated CEA level of 7.2 and slightly elevated CA125 of 59. Please refer to the discharge summary when it is available for full details."
2448,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"Her laboratory studies at today's visit showed a hemoglobin of 12.1, a white count of 7900 with 71% PMNs, 12% lymphocytes and platelets 289,000. Her liver function tests were all normal. (The CT scan of her lungs did include her upper abdomen, and there was no evidence of metastasis in the liver, and the adrenal glands were normal bilaterally.} Her CEA at today's visit was 1.9 which is certainly not elevated and, thus, it appears that her primary tumor is probably not producing this substance, so we cannot use it as a marker."
2449,CEA,carcinoembryonic antigen,"The ovaries appeared to be normal. Paracentesis was then performed and was positive for adenocarcinoma. The cells were CK-20 negative and estrogen receptor positive. A CEA was negative. This supported a GYN primary for her adenocarcinoma. Discussion was undertaken with the patient including the risks, benefits, and alternatives to proceeding with surgical diagnosis and staging, and the patient gave informed consent to go ahead with the above-named procedure."
2450,CVP,central venous pressure,"He had not had any problems with cytopenias. However, he had been told that he had reached the limit of CVP that he could receive because of substantial peripheral neuropathy. The patient had received some response to his last cycles of CVP with shrinkage of his tumor mass. He had resumed a macrobiotic diet in _%#MM2003#%_. The patient had a bone marrow biopsy done on _%#MMDD2002#%_."
2451,CVP,central venous pressure,"1. Postpartum hemorrhage. 2. Hemorrhagic shock. 3. DIC. RECOMMENDATIONS: Transfuse p.r.n. Monitor CVP. Fluids per CVP and clinical status; currently getting normal saline at 200 cc per hour. We will give additional boluses and colloid, if necessary. Monitoring hematology and coagulation parameters."
2452,CVP,central venous pressure,"PLAN: Our plan will be to continue the present course with broad antibiotic therapy while awaiting cultures, IV insulin p.r.n., stress hydrocortisone therapy after cosyntropin stimulation test, pressor therapy as needed, generous saline infusion, monitoring central venous pressure (CVP) and SVO2. We will give the patient's usual L-thyroxine dose in IV format. We will add an empiric H2 blocker. For now we will allow small amounts of clear liquids p.o. and advance diet as appropriate."
2453,CVP,central venous pressure,"PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: In general, she is an ill- appearing, intubated female who is having rhythmic contractions of the body. VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 125/67, pulse 87, respiratory rate 22, temperature 98.3, weight 89 kg. Her CVP is 20. She is right handed. Oxygen saturations are 95%. NEUROLOGIC: She is intubated and unresponsive to any noxious stimuli."
2454,CVP,"cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone","Mr. _%#NAME#%_ is a 73-year-old male with a longstanding history of follicular lymphoma with recent transformation. Originally diagnosed in 2001, he has been treated in the past with chlorambucil; rituximab; CVP; and fludarabine, Novantrone, dexamethasone (FND). He received 4 cycles of FND from _%#MM#%_ 2004 through _%#MM#%_ 2005. He received another course of fludarabine and mitoxantrone in _%#MM#%_ 2006."
2455,CVP,central venous pressure,"We will volume resuscitate him tonight. He will need levophed which we will do titrate to a MAP greater than 60. He will need to have CVP checked later and he may need fluid tap, which could certainly lower his blood pressure at some point. His lactate is elevated 3.7. I would like to avoid any peripheral squeezers for the time being and continue levophed."
2456,CVP,central venous pressure,"The patient has a history of severe deforming arthritis, severe kyphosis, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. She underwent an echocardiogram in _%#MM#%_ 2003 which demonstrated mild-to-moderate posterior mitral annular calcification, severely decreased left ventricular systolic function with an estimated ejection fraction of 10-15%, mild-to-moderate decrease in right ventricular systolic contractility, but size was within normal limits, and she had moderate mitral regurgitation and trileaflet aortic valve with moderate aortic sclerosis, moderate tricuspid insufficiency with severe pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular systolic pressures of 49 mm Hg plus CVP, and there was no evidence of pericardial effusion. She was admitted to Fairview Southdale Hospital on _%#MMDD2004#%_ with an exacerbation of her congestive heart failure."
2457,CVP,central venous pressure,"PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient's past medical history is remarkable for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diagnosed in 1998 with tender lymphadenopathy and leukocytosis. The patient was treated with fludarabine, but had poor response. Then he was given eight cycles of CVP, with good response. The patient was in remission for approximately one year, but his disease recurred. At that time, he was given chlorambucil, with poor response, but eight additional cycles of CVP given in the middle of 2000 produced pretty satisfactory disease control."
2458,CVP,central venous pressure,ASSESSMENT: Etiology of the primary condition is not clear. He has a cardiomyopathy with a very low ejection fraction and chest x-ray looks like congestive heart failure though central venous pressure (CVP) has been low and he seems to have responded to volume. He may be septic and this could be an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) picture.
2459,CVP,central venous pressure,"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Hypoplastic left heart status post Norwood and Sano procedures. OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Echocardiogram on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004, showing 2+ to 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, RV systolic pressure 100 plus CVP, aortic arch narrowing with a gradient of 20 mmHg, peak 70 mmHg, 78 mmHg Sano gradient. 2. Cardiac catheterization showed good anatomy of the branch pulmonary arteries status post Norwood-Sano."
2460,CVP,central venous pressure,"The patient has demonstrated atrial fibrillation since admission. Current rate is about 100, as has been the case. Blood pressure is 110/70. CVP is 10-12. Oxygen saturation is 97%. SKIN: Warm with good turgor and color. LUNGS: Reduced sounds on the right, the left is clear."
2461,CVP,central venous pressure,"VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 97.8, pulse 90, blood pressure 91/51, respirations 20, oxygen saturations 95% on 4 liters per minute by nasal cannula. CVP is 4 central venous oxygen saturation is 80%. HEENT: Pupils are round and reactive, sclerae white, conjunctiva moist, pink."
2462,CVP,central venous pressure,"PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: In the ICU initially: Temperature 97.9, blood pressure 90s-50s on multiple pressors, heart rate 100, respiratory rate 24, sats 96% on 100% FiO2. PA pressures 40/11, CVP 12. GENERAL: She is intubated and sedated. HEENT: Shows significant facial and periorbital edema. Pupils are reactive. She moves her head a little bit. NEUROLOGIC: Unable to do an exam given all the sedation she is on."
2463,CVP,"cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone",Bone marrow biopsy _%#MMDD2004#%_ showed 30 percent involvement with a low-grade lymphoproliferative disorder with plasmacytic differentiation consistent with a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma or possible Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. The patient was recently treated with Rituxan plus CVP. Her second cycle was administered about a week prior to her admission. She received a dose of Neulasta the day after her chemotherapy.
2464,CVP,central venous pressure,Note a normal BNP was measured earlier. 3. Review his tuberculosis medications for renal failure and adjustments may need to be made (doubt that any of the medications were primarily responsible for ATN though pyrazinamide has been reported to produce interstitial nephritis). 4. Central venous pressure (CVP) would be helpful if we continue to moderately aggressive care short of intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
2465,CVP,central venous pressure,"Electrolytes were within normal limits. Creatinine 1.14. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a 35-year-old gentleman status post HeartMate 2 LVAD is doing well. We will start weaning his milrinone in 12 hours if his CVP remains low. We will also continue heparin drip and maintain a therapeutic PTT. We will also remove his chest tube today. Otherwise, I am pleased with progress."
2466,CVP,central venous pressure,"Her extremities are cool. HEENT: Otherwise normal. CHEST: Has bilateral rales. CARDIOVASCULAR: There is a soft S1 but a loud systolic ejection murmur, which is late peaking. Her CVP is 14. ABDOMEN: She has significant truncal obesity but no significant hepatosplenomegaly, at least on palpation. LOWER EXTREMITIES: Cool with nonpalpable pulses. MUSCULOSKELETAL: Grossly within normal limits."
2467,CVP,central venous pressure,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. _%#NAME#%_ is a 62-year-old man who is critically ill, status post ruptured left iliac aneurysm repair. 1. Hypotension. The patient is responding to IV fluid boluses and still oxygenating well. His CVP is pretty low, so we will continue aggressive fluid resuscitation. There is no clear evidence of sepsis at this point, though he is developing a bit of a fever, as his temperature has gone from 97.8 the 99.2. Cultures have not yet been drawn and he is on cefazolin."
2468,CVP,central venous pressure,"White blood cell count 7.6. Echocardiogram dated _%#MMDD2004#%_ shows ejection fraction of 25% with global hypokinesis with trace mitral regurgitation, mild aortic sclerosis, pulmonary artery pressure at 31 plus CVP that is unchanged from prior study. BNP is 530. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is awake, alert and no acute distress."
2469,CVP,central venous pressure,"From a cardiac standpoint, the patient does have cardiac failure with known left ventricular failure and now an elevation in the right ventricular pressures. Her CVP was 26 yesterday and is about 18 to 20, which is her standard baseline. We have aggressively diuresed her and again she has some pulmonary congestion on her chest x-ray."
2470,CVP,central venous pressure,"REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient is unable to report. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: CVP in place, pulse 84, blood pressure 134/50. Respirations: The patient is vented. Weight is up to 109 kg from 105.9. Temperature 97 currently, and that is the max."
2471,CVP,central venous pressure,Would recommend infectious disease follow up for further advice on antibiotic treatment. She will need a central venous catheter for IV access and monitoring of CVP. Blood pressure support would maximize Dopamine at 10 MCG/KG/MIN and then go to Norepinephrine. Consider the addition of Vasopressin. Will check urine sodium and creatinine fractional secretion of sodium.
2472,CVP,central venous pressure,This was improved by changing her Imdur dosing to the evening rather than the morning. Her pulmonary artery catheter was replaced x 1 for further monitoring. She was gently diuresed to improve her CVP as well as wedge pressures. Her pulmonary artery catheter was removed and she was transferred to the floor for further observation.
2473,CVP,central venous pressure,"It should be noted a previous hemodynamic evaluation has included a negative stress echo performed in _%#MM#%_ of 2002. There is some question regarding the patient's low volume status. He has a CVP that is currently running in the range of 6-8. 3. Long standing history of hypertension. 4. History of tobacco use, smoking up until this admission"
2474,CVP,"cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone","He was initially diagnosed in 1995 with a large cell lymphoma and responded to CHOP chemotherapy but had residual low-grade lymphoma in the bone marrow. He has since been extensively treated with oral Cytoxan, Rituxan, FMD, CVP and COPE. He still has residual disease and our plan is to try cytoreductive treatment with systemic chemotherapy, using Rituxan plus DHAP and if he does get a good response, he will be transferred to the University of Minnesota for non- myoablative bone marrow transplantation from an unrelated donor or cord blood."
2475,CVP,central venous pressure,"PLAN: 1. The patient is admitted to the Intensive Care Unit under diabetic ketoacidosis protocol orders. This includes insulin drip. 2. Vigorous rehydration. 3. Rule out myocardial infarction protocol. 4. CVP monitoring. 5. Will add TSH and Free T4 to admitting labs, as well as a Tox screen, EKG, and alcohol level. 6. The patient is pan-cultured. No antibiotics will be given at this time."
2476,CVP,central venous pressure,"RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Weaning attempt with ventilator to extubation if possible. 2. Fluid and colloid boluses as pressors are reduced. 3. Will give more sodium bicarbonate this morning. 4. Monitor CVP, basic IV is normal saline and volume pending CVP readings. 5. Nutrition support, will start TPN. 6. IV Protonix for GI prophylaxis."
2477,CVP,central venous pressure,"REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Not currently possible. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: She is a thin, frail, elderly female currently lying in bed. VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98 degrees, pulse 64, blood pressure 106/59, respirations 12, CVP is 9. Weight is 42.5 kilograms. HEENT: No evidence of head trauma. Pupils are round and reactive. There is arcus senilis, sclerae white."
2478,CVP,central venous pressure,"Will follow blood gas intermittently. 3. Cardiovascular: Will monitor patient closely from cardiovascular standpoint including blood pressure monitoring and CVP monitoring. Given patient's excellent cardiac status postoperatively, patient is likely to do well. 4. Gastrointestinal: Will make patient n.p.o. at this time and give him Zantac q.8 h."
2479,CVP,central venous pressure,"She required volume resuscitation in the form of 2 liters of saline and ultimately was placed on dopamine and her current blood pressure is in the range of 115 and her dopamine has subsequently been discontinued. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Ongoing IV fluids. 2. IV colloid as needed to maintain elevated central venous pressure (CVP) in addition to blood pressure. 3. Calcium gluconate for cardiac protection. 4. Insulin and glucose for reduction of potassium, in addition to correction of her pH."
2480,CVP,central venous pressure,"She is uncomfortable with the tube in her throat and she feels anxious. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is awake, responds to questions, temperature 101 degrees, blood pressure in the 90's/40's, pulse is 130, sinus tachycardia, CVP is 8, weight is 50 kilos, respiratory rate is 20 (backup rate is 10). HEENT: She has an NG tube through the nose. There is no external evidence of bleeding."
2481,CVP,central venous pressure,"No increased respiratory effort. CARDIOVASCULAR: Distant heart sounds, S1, S2 without murmur, gallop or rub. There is JVD of approximately 6-7 cm with HJR. There is also a late Kussmaul's rise in CVP with deep inspiration. ABDOMEN: Quite obese, but soft, tender without bruits, organomegaly or mass. Femoral pulses are grossly normal without bruits. EXTREMITIES: Pedal pulses are 1-2+ and symmetrical."
2482,CVP,central venous pressure,IMPRESSION: 1. The patient is postoperative. Her blood pressure has decreased. She got her normal saline bolus and 2 units of packed cells. Since her CVP is low we are going to give her colloid and change her IV over the normal saline. 2. Respiratory anesthesia. Will be weaning her because she has this double bore ETT in place and they will manage this.
2483,CVP,central venous pressure,"Arterial blood gases are excellent: pH 7.4, pO2 128, pCO2 34. CHEST X-RAY: Satisfactory postoperative chest x-ray. A CVP line is in good position. Thank you for the opportunity to assist in Ms. _%#NAME#%_'s care."
2484,CVP,central venous pressure,"She was started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin. In the ER and in the Intensive Care Unit, she was given about 20 liters of fluid and her CVP has come up, but she still remains on norepinephrine. She is now making urine after being pretty significantly dehydrated it appears."
2485,CVP,central venous pressure,"Today she is on the ventilator. She is not sedated but minimally responsive. She is on 100% Fi02 and 10 of PEEP. Her cardiac output is 3.5. SVR 1004. PAD 22. CVP 13. She is on dopamine, neo- synephrine, and insulin drip. She is also getting some IV fluids. Right now her pulse is 115."
2486,CVP,central venous pressure,"She has normal lids, conjunctivae and sclerae. Her mouth shows good dentition. The posterior pharynx is good. NECK: Neck is supple, no adenopathy. CHEST: There are clear bilateral breath sounds. HEART: The CVP is about 13. She has a regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. There is a II/VI systolic murmur. ABDOMEN: The abdomen is distended and she has an umbilical hernia."
2487,CVP,central venous pressure,"GENERAL: The patient is in no acute distress. HEENT: Head is atraumatic, normocephalic. EENT examination is within normal limits. NECK: Neck examination demonstrates no significant JVD with an approximately CVP of 6. No bruits are appreciated. CARDIOVASCULAR: Irregularly irregular rhythm without the presence of murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Heart tones are soft. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Benign without the presence of distention or tenderness and bowel sounds are present."
2488,CVP,central venous pressure,There was no tricuspid regurgitation. There was mild pulmo nary insufficiency. The patient's pulmonary artery diastolic pressure was equal to 20 plus CVP. The patient's mean pulmonary artery pressure was 32 plus CVP. The patient's septal motion was consistent with systemic right ventricular pressure.
2489,CVP,central venous pressure,"She is alert and oriented times three, complaining of pain. VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 100/50, pulse 70 and regular, temperature 98.4, respirations 12, CVP line is in place and measures 10 cm. HEENT: There is no obvious scleral icterus. NECK: No JVD or bruits. LUNGS: Clear to P&A. HEART: Normal sinus rhythm. No definite murmur."
2490,CVP,central venous pressure,"PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITALS: He is obtunded, unresponsive, afebrile, sp02 is 93% on 15 liter rebreather mask, pulse 78, blood pressure is now 70/50, pulse is 64. NECK: Neck is supple and nontender with elevated CVP. LUNGS: Diminished breath sounds bilaterally. HEART: Normal S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm. ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender. EXTREMITIES: Warm without clubbing or edema. Thank you for this consultation."
2491,CVP,central venous pressure,"HABITS: No tobacco or drug usage. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 100.0 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure 120s-140s/60s-80s, heart rate in the 80s, respiratory rate 22-26. Sats 98% on 100% BiPAP which has since been reduced. Weight is 105.7 kilograms. PA pressures 57-61/27-32. Wedge is around 30. CVP 13-15. GENERAL: He is pleasant, in no acute distress. Alert and oriented x3. Mood is good. Affect appropriate. He is lying flat on his back."
2492,CVP,central venous pressure,"She has moderate to severe MR but I wonder how severe it actually is because the left atrium is not enlarged. As noted in the previous notes, the right-sided pressures were essentially mildly elevated but the CVP quite low at 4 when she had her heart catheterization and her current CVP on the echo that I reviewed is likely to be less than 5 as the IVC is small and collapses easily. It may be that we cannot diurese here altogether that fully because of low right-sided pressures but that close observation of weight and breathlessness and status may keep her out of trouble for the next few years."
2493,CVP,central venous pressure,"Postoperatively, the patient was taken back to the ICU. His tremors were not longer present. The patient was on Zosyn for prophylaxis. A central line was placed to monitor the patient's CVP on the evening of _%#MMDD2006#%_. The patient was transferred back to the floor on _%#MMDD2006#%_, he continued to have low-grade temperatures, but is blood pressure was stable."
2494,CVP,central venous pressure,"ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE: Vital signs: Temperature 98.1. Pulse 88. Blood pressure 111/65. Respirations 18. The patient's oxygen saturation is fine on room air. Neck: Estimated CVP is 8 to 10 cm. Lungs: Mild bibasilar crackles, otherwise clear. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm with a 1 to 2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border."
2495,CVP,central venous pressure,"Lastly, he meets the criteria for activated protein C for sepsis, and we will start this today. To support his blood pressure, we will place him on Levophed as he has an adequate CVP and appears to be volume resuscitated. 2. Pulmonary hypertension. Echo during his hospital stay showed some pulmonary hypertension with PA systolics in the 40s and a dilated RV."
2496,CVP,central venous pressure,"The patient underwent re-measurement of his right heart hemodynamics, which continued to show elevated pulmonary pressures of 50 x 34 with a CVP of 14. In view of this, we recommend left ventricular assist device placement as a bridge to transplant because of his moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension."
2497,CVP,central venous pressure,"Chest x-ray dated _%#MMDD2003#%_ is unchanged. ABG 7.49/32/172/25. Total protein 3.6, albumin 1.4. White blood cell count 9.0. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Mechanical ventilator settings SIMV, Fi02 40s, rate of 12, PEEP of 5, respiratory support of 5, tidal volume 500, minute ventilation 10 L per minute. Respiratory rate is 24. She is afebrile. Pulse is 134. SP02 100%. CVP 4. Blood pressure 120/80. GENERAL APPEARANCE: She is an elderly female who appears older than her stated age. HEENT: Unremarkable. NECK: Supple, nontender. No lymphadenopathy. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally."
2498,CVP,central venous pressure,"PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He grimaces during the exam, but opens eyes, but cannot communicate. The blood pressure is 110/50, pulse is 85-95, he is now afebrile. Respiratory rate is 18. O2 saturation is 100% CVP 10-12, previously now 9. His urine output has been 68 to 100 ccs. per hour. His vent settings are CMV at 9, FiO2 at 50%."
2499,CVP,central venous pressure,She also appears to have a large right ventricle. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Central line and CVP monitoring keeping in mind that she does have tricuspid valve disease. 2. Atrial line placement. 3. Panculture. 4. IV fluids.
2500,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,"The likelihood that _%#NAME#%_ is a carrier is 1 in 50. That means that there is a 1 in 200, or 0.5% chance that _%#NAME#%_ and _%#NAME#%_'s pregnancy will be affected with SMA. After talking with _%#NAME#%_ and _%#NAME#%_, they felt that they would not alter the management of the pregnancy based on a diagnosis of SMA."
2501,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"Occluded left common iliac artery. Moderate to severe stenosis at the origin of the right common iliac artery. 3. MRI abdomen with MRA _%#MMDD2006#%_: The celiac trunk, SMA, and IMA are patent at their origins. Severe stenosis in the proximal right renal artery. Occluded left common iliac artery."
2502,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"She experienced no chills, rigors, or change in bowel or bladder function. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She has a past medical history that includes chronic pancreatitis, status post cyst debridement, status post distal pancreatectomy, status post colonic perforation with colostomy, hyperlipidemia, status post splenectomy, diabetes mellitus, ERCP with multiple stent placements with an extra hepatic biliary obstruction, duodenal stricture, portal venous, splenic venous, and SMA thrombosis, acute renal failure, depression, cerebral vascular accident with seizure disorder, gastroesophageal reflux. The patient was admitted NPO. She was given IV hydration and IV pain control."
2503,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,She was seen by genetic counselor _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_. Subsequently both parents were tested for MCAD disease and _%#NAME#%_ is a carrier while _%#NAME#%_ is not. Then _%#NAME#%_ was tested for SMA due to her elevated CK and was found to be a carrier. Subsequently both parents were tested as well as blood from original newborn screening from _%#NAME#%_ where DNA was extracted and tested for SMA.
2504,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,He had a gastroesophageal ultrasound on _%#MMDD2004#%_ by Dr. _%#NAME#%_. _%#NAME#%_ which showed a lesion penetrating through the muscularis propria. The patient also had enlarged lymph node at the SMA and SMD which showed negative findings on needle aspiration. He lost 30 pounds since _%#MMDD#%_ due to sprue.
2505,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"A CAT scan was done as an outpatient basis the day prior to admission with result as above. An upper GI with Gastrografin solution was then performed with result as above. There was some initial concern about SMA syndrome. He was sent to emergency from Boynton Health Center. ER consulted surgery, especially as lactic acid level was slightly high at 3.1, who do not think that this finding represent SMA syndrome."
2506,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"9. Docusate 100 mg p.o. q. day. FOLLOW-UP PLANS: 1. Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in one week. 2. Dr. _%#NAME#%_ at _%#COUNTY#%_ _%#COUNTY#%_ Medical Center endocrinology _%#MMDD2002#%_ with the patient to receive urinalysis, SMA 7 and hemoglobin A1C prior to appointment. 3. Home health care to be seen _%#MMDD2002#%_. 4. Diet: Diabetic 1800 kilocalorie."
2507,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"8. Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 40%. 9. Atrial fibrillation. 10. History of mesenteric ischemia with stenting of the SMA. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Blood pressure 129/39, pulse of 50, temperature 96.0, respiratory rate 16."
2508,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"She was transferred to the University of Minnesota for a second attempt at SMA stenting. As the previous attempt at stenting of the SMA was from a groin approach, we elected to perform a left upper extremity approach. Again, the superior mesenteric artery was noted to be occluded, but both the celiac access and the inferior mesenteric artery appeared patent."
2509,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"12. Combivent two puffs inhaled p.o. q.i.d. 13. Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. FOLLOW-UP: His follow-up is with the Electrophysiology Clinic with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in three to four weeks with a repeat SMA -10 check in one week. The patient was hypokalemic during this hospitalization as he was getting IV Lasix, and it was replaced aggressively."
2510,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"The patient was stabilized here in the Emergency Room. She had mild hypertension at 182/97 on admission. No other significant findings, with a normal CBC and SMA, normal sed rate. FAMILY HISTORY: Seems unremarkable/noncontributory. SOCIAL HISTORY: Includes her living alone."
2511,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"LAB DATA: CBC results are normal. Coags are normal. Myoglobin is 17, troponin I less than 0.07. Platelets 199. BNP is 8. D-Dimer is negative at .2. SMA 12 results are normal. EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. Heart rate of 63, no acute changes, no old EKG for comparison."
2512,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES PERFORMED: NJ replacement by interventional radiology. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: _%#NAME#%_ is an 18-year-old female with a history of chronic vomiting, gastroparesis, and GI feed dependent, SMA syndrome, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. She presents acutely with vomiting and increased abdominal pain since prior afternoon. She was seen in clinic one day prior to admission for regular followup and no changes were made to the home routine."
2513,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,"She had a genetic study done for SMA, which was still pending at the end of her hospitalization. Because her symptoms aren't typical for SMA, it was recommended that she get an MRI as an outpatient. Her tone was generally considered to be improved by the end of her hospitalization but was still lower than normal for her age."
2514,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,The patient was not placed on Coumadin because of his recent history of GI bleed. 4. Abdominal pain evaluated with a MRA. A SMA stenosis was seen but it was felt that this should be treated medically as she did not have classic symptoms of ischemic bowel.
2515,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,She reports nausea and some early spotting and cramping in the current pregnancy. The focus of our discussion was _%#NAME#%_'s family history of spinal muscular atrophy type I (SMA type I). Therefore we began by obtaining a family history. _%#NAME#%_'s sister is 27 years old and was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in infancy.
2516,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,Subsequently both parents were tested as well as blood from original newborn screening from _%#NAME#%_ where DNA was extracted and tested for SMA. It turned out that _%#NAME#%_ actually died from spinal muscular atrophy and had a homozygous deletion of the SMN gene as well as an NAIP.
2517,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"She is not tremulous. Motor, sensory and coordination are intact. MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION: Per Dr. _%#NAME#%_. LABORATORY DATA: Laboratories are ordered and are pending, including SMA 18. T4 and TSH will also be obtained."
2518,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"RECTAL: Exam is deferred. EXTREMITIES: Unremarkable NEUROLOGIC: Exam is grossly intact. LABS: Electrolytes unremarkable. Potassium of 4.1, MRI of the abdomen, 40-50% of celiac axis, unremarkable SMA, IMIA not identified. CT scan of the abdomen pending. Leiden mutation analysis is unremarkable. ASSESSMENT: 1. Severe colitis, presumably C-Difficile related, await old records."
2519,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,We do not see free air. Pelvic portion of the exam is somewhat limited due to artifact caused by the recently-placed hip. The patient also has significant calcifications of the aorta involving the region of the SMA ostia. The IMA cannot be identified. IMPRESSION: 1. Probable ischemic colitis secondary to postoperative hypertension.
2520,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"CT suggests her stomach is markedly distended without material moving into the duodenum, may have some type of pyloric stenosis or SMA syndrome or other process at this time. Plan is to place NG tube, keep her n.p.o. and use IV fluids. Will have GI consult and probably scope tomorrow if her stomach can be cleared."
2521,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"The tagged red cell study came back and showed bleeding in her transverse colon. She underwent an angiogram of the celiac and SMA with embolization of the left gastric artery on _%#MMDD2002#%_. At this time, her Port-A-Cath became infected and it was removed."
2522,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"5. Depression. 6. Frequent ear infection, mastoiditis in _%#MM#%_ 2002. 7. History of Candida pneumonia. 8. History of VRE bacteremia. 9. History of SMA syndrome. 10. Pansinusitis. 11. Hypertension. SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives with his mother. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam in the ER his vitals were as follows: temperature 108, pulse 102, respirations 16, blood pressure 99/60, O2 sats 96%."
2523,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"UAC in the umbilical stalk. Large mucosal defect inferior to the omphalocele with abnormal genitalia and hemiscrotum. EXTREMITIES: Lower extremities demonstrate club feet. LABORATORY: PH of 7.39, SMA 6, normal hemoglobin of 16.2 yesterday. ASSESSMENT/PLAN: A 5-day-old infant with OEIS complex. Team plans for surgery as soon as they can stabilize his pulmonary status."
2524,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"You are referred to Dr. _%#NAME#%_'s previously dictated discharge summary. ADDENDUM The results of the MRI of the abdomen show patent SMA, patent IMA, mild stenosis celiac mesenteric artery; however, not significant enough to account for the patient's symptoms. No convincing evidence of intestinal ischemia."
2525,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,She also underwent MR angiography which showed a subtotal occlusion of her celiac axis as well as a possible significant stenosis in the SMA. The IMA was not visualized. IMPRESSION: Ischemic colitis. I believe that standard angiography is indicated to further delineate this patient's vascular disease.
2526,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"Due to the relatively young age of the patient, hypercoagulable workup has been undertaken and are pending at the time of discharge. The patient also had an MRA of the abdomen to evaluate for any stenosis of the celiac SMA or IMA vessels. At the time of discharge, the patient was not tolerating a normal diet and was able to control her pain with oral pain medications."
2527,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"5. If the small bowel obstruction continues to improve may consider upper endoscopy at a later time to look for varices or other evidence of portal hypertension. 6. Check serum protein electrophoresis. 7. Check SMA, antismooth muscle antibody, ANA, antinuclear antibody, antimitochondrial antibody. 8. Check hepatitis serologies. 9. Check ferritin and iron studies. 10. May be reasonable to try patient on a trial regimen of lactulose to see if this reduces his risk of recurrence of encephalopathy, however would not start this until after the small bowel obstruction is completely resolved."
2528,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"He proved to have some collateral circulation, so lysis and heparinization continued. However, while he did have some collateral circulation he continued to have an SMA occlusion and therefore earlier today he was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy by Dr. _%#NAME#%_. Findings there included a gangrenous proximal jejunum, mid SMA thrombotic occlusion and Mr. _%#NAME#%_ underwent resection of the proximal jejunum as well as an SMA endarterectomy with vein patch angioplasty."
2529,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"I reviewed the CT scan of _%#MMDD2007#%_, which shows a 3.2 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm, colon wall thickening of the distal transverse and descending colon and there is aortic calcification just cephalad to the origin of the SMA, but there is no clear stenosis of the SMA. The IMA itself was not visible. IMPRESSION: Ischemic colitis, possibly secondary to dehydration from a viral illness (versus viral colitis with bleeding secondary to anticoagulation)."
2530,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"DTRs 1+ diffusely. Plantars are downgoing. LABORATORY DATA: Showed a white count of 4.3, hemoglobin 13.7, hematocrit 39.8, platelets 151, sodium 132, potassium 3.8, chloride 97, CO2 26, BUN 17, creatinine 1.03, hemoglobin A1c a week ago was 5.8. CT of the chest showed extensive descending thoracic aortic dissection, measuring about 6.3 cm extending to below the SMA with no change from _%#MMDD2006#%_. MRI of the head per ER report showed a significant small vessel disease. EKG is sinus rhythm and rate of 61 per minute, occasional PA-C, low voltage diffusely, more so in the limb leads with Q-waves in inferior leads consistent with possible old inferior infarct."
2531,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"We asked surgery to consult on the patient for further evaluation of this. They recommended doing a CT angiogram, which has an official read pending at this time. Unofficially, it appears that the SMA and IMA are wide open and patent. She did have an elevated lactate at 2.7, but this had normalized to 2.1 prior to discharge."
2532,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA: His white count was 8.5 and hemoglobin 9.3. Of note, his hemoglobin was 12.2 on _%#MMDD#%_, ten days prior to admission. His platelets was 257, and troponin was less than 0.07. His INR was 1.14. He had a normal SMA 7. His calcium was decreased at 7.7 along with his albumin, which was decreased at 3.0. Again, he had a fecal occult blood test that was positive."
2533,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"He had a CT scan of the abdomen performed in the emergency department that demonstrated a large stomach with finding that were suggestive of SMA syndrome. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Gastric outlet obstruction secondary to SMA syndrome: As noted above, the patient was taken to the operating room on the _%#DD#%_ for a decompressive duodenojejunostomy."
2534,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"Creatinine in the emergency room was about baseline and admitted for further workup. Vital signs stable on admission. No flank tenderness and otherwise normal exam. White count 17.4, hemoglobin 13, platelets 193. SMA 7 normal, BUN 26, creatinine 2.5. He had a renal ultrasound the day prior to admission revealing the 4 anechoic masses mentioned above."
2535,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"3. Follow up with the GI Clinic within a week and to reassess need for paracentesis with Primary Care Medicine Clinic at Fairview-University Medical Center. He needs follow-up labs, which include INR, PT, SMA 10 and CBC. The patient will call."
2536,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"She also felt like her energy level was dropping, her appetite was declining, and she had lost about 60 pounds. She had a CT scan of her abdomen performed which revealed extensive lymphadenopathy encompassing her SMA as well as the celiac axis. There was adenopathy posterior to the pancreas, elevating the pancreas away from the spine."
2537,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"11. Abdominal aortic aneurysm with large amount of thrombus followed by Dr. _%#NAME#%_, measures 5.7 cm in AP diameter at the level of the lower kidneys and 5.3 cm in the upper abdomen just below the SMA by chest CT _%#MMDD2007#%_. 12. Recent patchy bilateral infiltrates treated for pneumonia, noted on chest CT _%#MM2007#%_, described as multifocal areas of infiltrate, airspace opacity throughout both lungs."
2538,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"6. Octreotide 150 mcg subcu t.i.d. for abdominal pain and to decrease secretions. FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS: The patient will follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ as an outpatient with CBC, cholesterol, triglycerides, SMA 10 before the next visit. He will also continue on with his home-care help to receive TPN from home services and appropriate labs for them."
2539,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"The presumed diagnosis was intestinal angina and an MRA was ultimately performed. The MRA revealed a 50 percent narrowing of the SMA and a right-sided approximate 4 cm mass in the liver, which was partially blocking the intrahepatic ducts. A CT-guided liver biopsy was then performed on _%#MMDD2003#%_. Pathology from the biopsy revealed infiltrative, moderately differentiated, mucin-producing adenocarcinoma."
2540,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"7. He will also call if there is any increase in temperature or pain. 8. He will also have home health care followup and tomorrow, on _%#MMDD2004#%_, he should have an SMA drawn and these results will be called in to the renal fellow. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: He will go home on: 1. Zantac 150 mg p.o. daily."
2541,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,6. Multinodular goiter. 7. Depression. 8. Hypercholesterolemia. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. Aorto SMA bypass graft. 2. Auto renal transplant for renal artery stenosis. 3. Right renal artery repair. 4. Left oophorectomy. 5. Nissan fundoplication.
2542,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"He had another tagged red blood cell which suggested a left upper quadrant source, possibly jejunum. On _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004, he underwent angiography of the SMA and IMA in _%#CITY#%_ with heparin provocation. No source of bleeding was found at that time. He subsequently developed acute cholecystitis by HIDA scan and underwent an open cholecystectomy."
2543,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,"According to University of Pennsylvania both DNA direct testing for spinal muscular atrophy, as well as linkage analysis involving DNA sample from their late daughter _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, husband _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, and _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, both of these results were normal thus consistent with a developing baby not to be expected to have SMA or spinal muscular atrophy. Copies of these records were faxed to your office. These results were communicated to this patient by phone."
2544,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,"We discussed the rare possibility of ambiguous results or the cells not growing and we could offer a follow-up amniocentesis in that particular instance. We discussed options available if a baby was found to have SMA prenatally, including continuation of pregnancy or termination of pregnancy. We thoroughly updated their family history during our genetic counseling session."
2545,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,"A biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. On _%#MMDD2004#%_, the patient was seen by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ at _%#COUNTY#%_ _%#COUNTY#%_ Medical Center where an esophageal ultrasound showed that the lesion invaded into the muscularis propria and also had enlarged nodes at the SMA and SMD. Needle aspiration of the three largest nodes were negative for malignancy. Therefore, the patient is ultrasound staged T2 N0 M0. Symptomatically, the patient states that his diarrhea has improved now that he is on the gluten-free diet."
2546,SMA,superior mesenteric artery,Please refer to their notes for full details. This test revealed a fistula between his duodenum and pancreas allograft Y graft arterial connection. It appeared to originate from the transplant SMA. Coil embolization was performed on this lesion with restoration of normal blood flow. By hospital day #2 Mr. _%#NAME#%_ was feeling well and his hemoglobin was stable at 10.2. He was asymptomatic with stable vital signs and was discharged home.
2547,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"The patient was instructed to take a regular diet and to follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in the Heme/Onc Clinic in 6 weeks and to follow up with repeat SMA 10 to assess renal function prior to his appointment with Dr. _%#NAME#%_. The patient was instructed to notify medical doctor if he experienced chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, fever, chills, pain or cough."
2548,SMA,spinal muscular atrophy,Thus the risk for the couple to have a child with SMA is approximately 1 in 400. The patient indicated at the time of her visit that she was not interested in pursuing carrier testing for SMA. We discussed the availability of ultrasounds throughout the pregnancy to screen for clinical features of early onset SMA such as fetal arthrogryposis.
2549,SMA,sequential multiple autoanalyzer,"Neurologic Exam: Grossly nonfocal. LABS: Thus far, an EKG reveals sinus bradycardia, but is otherwise normal. A chest x-ray is pending. SMA 7 is normal. Hemoglobin is 14.1, white count 8,800, platelet count is 168,000."
2550,PD,peritoneal dialysis,"The patient previously did require peritoneal dialysis into _%#MM#%_ 2003 for anuric renal failure, however, this was stopped when the patient developed peritonitis and PD catheter was removed. The patient also has hypertension with blood pressures running from 100 to 120 mmHg systolic. ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1. Lasix 9 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2. Amlodipine 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit."
2551,PD,peritoneal dialysis,"He was transferred back to 5A on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2006. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He was diagnosed with atypical HUS at 6 months of age. He was on PD for several days initially and has had no PD since. The cause of his hemolytic uremic syndrome is factor H deficiency."

2700,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Granddaughter with history of one episode of ITP. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. ITP diagnosed incidentally in 2001, status post treatment with WinRho and Prednisone. He has a history of being responsive to IV Ig. He has not had a splenectomy, although this has been considered."
2701,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"2. Junctional bradycardia. 3. Low platelet, etiology unclear. The patient to have follow-up of low platelet to rule out idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), drug-related or hypersplenism I did not see any drug-causing thrombocytopenia. 4. High INR and PTT secondary to vitamin K deficiency more likely."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 62-year-old white female with a known history of CLL who had development of chronic ITP and was recently admitted from _%#MMDD2007#%_ to _%#MMDD2007#%_ for IVIG treatment along with platelet transfusions. Unfortunately, the patient developed epistaxis after discharge as well as a skin laceration and was admitted again to an outside hospital Emergency Room and eventually transferred to the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview on _%#MMDD2007#%_ where she did not respond to medical treatment and unfortunately required a splenectomy."
2709,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"The kidney is horseshoe shaped. 2. Splenectomy performed by general surgery. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. _%#NAME#%_ is a 30-year-old male with a history of ITP diagnosed in 2002. He has been in remission after prednisone and IVIG, with a subsequent 3- to 4-month steroid taper. He has not had petechiae or bleeding symptoms in the interim."
2710,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Once the patient was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit at Fairview University Medical Center, she was delirious and through the medical record it was seen that she had a recent history of sepsis and thrombocytopenia. However, it was unclear of the cause of her sepsis. Her thrombocytopenia workup was treated like ITP and there was no mention of the patient being positive. Therefore, once she came to the ICU, a full workup for sepsis was started."
2711,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"This is also superimposed upon chronic essential tremor. As above, the patient did have unremarkable cerebrovascular evaluation earlier this year. She is not on aspirin because of chronic thrombocytopenia, which likely is medication related versus ITP. At this point, I think the patient definitely would benefit from the institution of aspirin with close monitoring of her platelet count."
2712,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"She was born on _%#MMDD2004#%_ at FUMC _%#CITY#%_ and transferred to the NICU on _%#MMDD2004#%_ and discharged on _%#MMDD2004#%_. The mother's pregnancy was complicated by severe ITP requiring steroids, splenectomy, and IVIG. The infant was delivered NSVD with Apgar scores of 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes. _%#NAME#%_ was a pre-term AGA female infant, 2980 gm at 35 weeks gestation, with a length of 48 cm and head circumference of 32.5 cm."
2713,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Upon repeat lab testing here, his platelet count was confirmed markedly decreased at 4000. However, his ANC was within the normal range at 1600. We elected to treat the patient for ITP with an IV injection of RhoGAM. After the patient received this injection, he did develop some fever, chills and intravascular hemolysis secondary to this medication."
2714,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Specifically a platelet count on _%#MMDD2005#%_ was 14,000 with white count at 7400, hemoglobin 14.1. BUN 16 and creatinine 0.9. Previous platelet count from _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004 was 207,000 with a hemoglobin 15.3, creatinine 0.9 at that point. She was initially placed on prednisone due to the presumptive diagnosis of ITP. With further history, however, it was apparent that her diagnosis was that of TTP. A repeat platelet count was then drawn on _%#MMDD2005#%_ which is 22,000."
2715,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"2. Parkinson's. 3. Diabetes. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 78-year-old man with a history of ITP who presented from home with a platelet count of 7. The patient has a longstanding history of diabetes, ITP, Parkinson disease as well as multiple medical illnesses.

2717,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"There is no laboratory evidence of thrombocytopenia during the _%#MM2006#%_ admission at UMCH nor was there a history of blood in stool or urine. The question of whether he had ITP variant as opposed to HSP. Psychiatry saw the patient because of his mood disorder which they attributed to steroid taper, and thought no medication was warranted other than supportive care, and reassurance."
2718,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"PRIMARY ONCOLOGIST: Dr. _%#NAME#%_ HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: _%#NAME#%_ is a 6-year-old female who is newly diagnosed with ITP last month. This past Monday, on _%#MMDD2007#%_, at a routine clinic visit, she was noted to have a platelet count of 22. Follow-up recheck on day of admission was 8. The patient was admitted from clinic for IVIG infusion overnight."
2719,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Other contributing factors may be a viral process such as Epstein-Barr or cytomegalovirus accounting for her sore throat, although she had a positive Rapid strep. I doubt HELP syndrome, ITP or TTP. She is not anemic. We will check antiplatelet antibody. We will check B12 and folate level, Epstein-Barr and cytomegalovirus IgMs are being checked."
2720,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"One year ago the patient was noted to have iron- deficiency anemia with hemoglobin of 10, MCV of 79, and ferritin of 9. He also has a history of thrombocytopenia with platelet count at 75,000 to 85,000 which was attributed to ITP. I do not have all the details of that evaluation. He has prior evaluation for his iron deficiency a couple of months ago, and upper endoscopy showed a small arteriovenous malformation in the stomach, and negative colonoscopy."
2721,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Despite her abnormal liver enzymes, her findings are inconsistent with HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets), which should resolve after delivery. Platelet associated immunoglobulin levels will also be obtained to evaluate the possibility of ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura). I would continue to monitor the patient's blood counts and watch for resolution of her thrombocytopenia as her infection improves with supportive management."
2722,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,6. History of tubal ligation in the past. 7. The patient has a history of chronic substance abuse and history of prostitution. 8. History of depression. 9. Hypothyroidism. 10. The patient had undergone high-dose steroid therapy and IVIG for ITP which was unresponsive to medical therapies. HOSPITAL COURSE: Hospitalizations for low platelet count. Surgery was consulted on the last admission which was _%#MM#%_.
2723,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"7. Dementia, unchanged during this hospitalization, on Aricept. 8. Asplenia. The patient is asplenic secondary to management of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Stable elevated platelet counts as one would expect.

2724,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Per routine postchemotherapy cell count monitoring, the patient did receive a transfusion of 2 units of packed cells on the second day of admission for a hemoglobin of 7.6. 4. ITP. As it was time for the patient's regular infusion of IVIG for treatment of ITP, this was administered during the current hospitalization."
2725,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives in _%#CITY#%_ with her husband and two children. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Hematologic: She has a history of ITP. No recent history of bleeding. The platelets have been stable. Musculoskeletal: Please see history of present illness. Gynecologic: She had a hysterectomy after her second delivery due to massive bleeding.

PAST OBSTETRIC HISTORY: Significant for NSVD at 36 weeks, induction secondary to IPT with 7 pounds 15 ounces, this was complicated by postpartum hemorrhage. PAST GYNECOLOGIC HISTORY: Significant for chlamydial infection in 2005. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for ITP and history of urinary tract infections. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None. SOCIAL HISTORY: She denies any tobacco or alcohol or drug use."
2727,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Platelet closure time at that time was normal. Thrombocytopenia felt potentially secondary to consumption related to the right upper extremity hematoma. Thought not to be consistent with ITP. Potential low-grade DIC secondary to neoplasm could not be excluded. No perioperative bleeding complications. No history of blood clots. Denies recent steroids.
2728,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"3. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, symptomatically well-controlled on Nexium. 4. Type II diabetes mellitus adequately controlled by diet. 5. History of renal calculus disease. 6. Status post splenectomy for ITP. Residual mild thrombocytopenia. 7. History of atrial fibrillation, presently maintained in a normal sinus rhythm. 8. Status post TURP for recurrent/chronic prostatitis. 9. Status post septoplasty/turbinoplasty."
2729,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"The patient was DNR/DNI. At the time of this readmission, this probably constitutes metastatic prostate cancer, with last chemotherapy given about two weeks ago; hypercoagulable state of malignancy; acute embolic stroke on _%#MMDD2002#%_, treated on Coumadin, with INR of 2.64 on _%#MMDD2002#%_; thrombocytopenia; secondary metastatic disease involving bone marrow, chemotherapy, and a component of ITP. Platelet count on _%#MMDD2002#%_ was noted to be 23,000. At this time of presentation, the patient appeared with liver insufficiency with ALT 671, AST 457, alkaline phosphatase 130, creatinine 1.3, and calcium 7.9. HOSPITAL COURSE: Platelet transfusions and FFP were given in the emergency room."
2730,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Gestational diabetes was in excellent control. She also had an episode of preterm labor which was stopped by terbutaline. The patient was scheduled for repeat cesarean section at 371/2 weeks because of her ITP, gestational diabetes, and previous cesarean section for a baby who was approximated at almost 81/2 pounds. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent repeat cesarean section under spinal anesthesia, with husband present."
2731,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for mother with diabetes and hypertension. Paternal grandmother and grandfather with coronary heart disease. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She denies any symptoms that may be related to ITP including epistaxis, melena or rectal bleeding, or menorrhagia. All other review of systems were negative. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: The patient appears to be in no acute distress."
2732,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Splenic sequestration could also explain her mild chronic leukopenia as well. Alternative explanations for the thrombocytopenia could include decreased destruction such as with chronic ITP or thrombocytopenia due to an anti- phospholipid antibody syndrome. A proliferative disorder is possible but considered much less likely given the very long natural history.
2733,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Coagulation battery is normal, including fibrinogen and D-dimer. Other labs, such as platelet antibodies and FANA are currently pending. IMPRESSION: Most likely diagnosis here is ITP. There is a low suspicion for drug-induced thrombocytopenia with a possible exception being amoxicillin, which the patient was taking recently."
2734,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Unfortunately, with her platelet count being significantly low one her ongoing epistaxis, I would recommend starting her treatment for a possible ITP with a high-dose steroid. I would also recommend obtaining platelet antibodies, ANA and rheumatoid factor to rule out any causes for a possible ITP."
2735,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"3. Bactrim, GI upset. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. History of systemic lupus erythematosus, diagnosed at age 21 with CNS and PNS involvement. No renal involvement at this time. 2. Rheumatoid arthritis. 3. ITP. 4. L3-L4 fusion secondary to five herniated disks and DJD. 5. Migraine headaches. 6. Endometriosis. 7. Stroke at age 21."
2736,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"She had no problems with her surgery at that time. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for ITP. She gets WinRho and Prednisone when she has low platelets. She was last checked in _%#MM#%_ and apparently had a platelet count in the 70,000 range."
2737,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"The patient's postoperative course has been significant for a postoperative wound infection, nausea, vomiting, acute tubular interstitial rejection (treated with steroids), and C4d positivity with a readmission on _%#MMDD2004#%_ for plasmapheresis and IVIG. The patient is also noted to have had pancytopenia secondary to ITP reaction and multiple attempts(?) of her immunosuppression regimen. The patient presents with an elevated creatinine of 2.94 on a regular weekly check of her laboratory work."
2738,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"MAINTENANCE MEDICATIONS: Lotrel for hypertension. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. History of hypertension. 2. ITP status post splenectomy 1997. 3. He states he had a peptic ulcer many years ago. 4. He consumes some alcohol, about one glass of beer or wine per day."
2739,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Cardiac echo as noted above. Prior ECG in _%#MM#%_ 2004 shows the right bundle branch block and her ECG has really not significantly changed. ASSESSMENT: 1. Uterine prolapse. 2. Thrombocytopenia which is likely ITP. There is a question of whether she has any rheumatologic disorder and this is currently being evaluated, but certainly she is feeling much better at this point and I do not think this should affect her surgical status."
2740,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"The remainder of the mouth and oropharynx nasopharyngoscopy and head and neck examination are normal. She does have a history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) but her platelet count has been normal. IMPRESSION: Lower lip mass, probable hemangioma. PLAN: I reviewed the findings at length with _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_."
2741,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura with bleeding. MAJOR PROCEDURES/TREATMENTS: Intravenous immunoglobulin infusion. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 74-year-old female with a history of ITP diagnosed in _%#MM#%_ 2002, status post steroid treatment, and after which a splenectomy was done since she did not tolerate a taper, in _%#MM#%_ 2002."
2742,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"She does have a history of TTP that was first diagnosed in _%#MM2000#%_ at which time she had a very complicated course. She was admitted to Mayo Hospital and had seizures and kidney involvement. In 2002, she had a relapse of her ITP. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. TTP. Patient had a very complicated course. Her platelet counts were low throughout her hospitalization."
2743,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,She has chronic problems with depression and is on Zoloft. She has hypothyroidism and she takes Synthroid. She had a previous history of ITP that was felt possibly secondary to quinine or nonsteroidals or Tylenol. She has avoided all those and still has persistently low platelet count but hasn't had any further bleeding.
2744,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Troponin less than 0.04. Myoglobin 33. N-terminal proBNP 98. IMPRESSION: 1. AICD discharged. 2. Severe ischemic heart disease. 3. Chronic thrombocytopenia due to ITP. 4. Hypertension. 5. Diabetes mellitus. 6. Mild acute renal failure. PLAN: Will rule out for myocardial infarction with serial troponin.
2745,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,The patient is currently on chronic prednisone to control her platelet count. 2. Status post thyroidectomy for presumed thyroid cancer. 3. Status post TAH for menorrhagia associated with her ITP with possible BSO. 4. Hyperlipidemia. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service for a possible airway threatening bleed.
2746,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"No active bleeding at this time, and his other cell counts appear normal. I wonder if there might be a component of low-grade idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). b. I will check a peripheral smear and consider a Hematology consultation if his counts do deteriorate."
2747,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) postpartum. 2. Insomnia related to steroids. 3. Moderate headache--resolved. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Prednisone 60 mg q.d. 2. Protonix 20 mg q.d.

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Repeat low transverse cesarean section. 2. Lysis of adhesions. COMPLICATIONS: None."
2749,ITP,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"Mr. _%#NAME#%_ is a 26-year-old white male with a previous history of aplastic anemia in 1998 and ITP in 2002, who presented to the ER today with complaints of petechial rash on lower extremities and wrists bilaterally, and appearing in the mouth over the last few days. He also complained of some mild streaks of blood with coughing. According to the patient, since his diagnosis of ITP about 2-1/2 years ago, the patient has had a few petechiae around his ankles on and off, but this petechial rash was definitively worse."
2750,AV,arteriovenous,A decision has been made to admit the patient under observation status to evaluate dialysis access options. The patient has longstanding end-stage renal disease. A left upper arm AV fistula which was created by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in _%#MM#%_ of 2004 has recently been not a good access due to high pressures and poor flow.
2751,AV,atrioventricular,"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Syncope. HOSPITAL COURSE: _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ was admitted with recurrent syncope. Was noted to be in third degree AV block. He received a dual chamber pacemaker with excellent results ands was paced 100% of the time on dismissal. He also had a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, but has not tolerated Coumadin in the past secondary to a GI bleed."
2752,AV,atrioventricular,"Chest x-ray shows very minor vascular congestion. Her ECG as noted above in history of present illness. IMPRESSION: 1. Third degree AV block with probable infranodal escape rhythm, probably due to Digoxin toxicity and high dose of betablocker. This is resolved now with the use of Digibind and cessation of Coreg."
2753,AV,atrioventricular,"No edema. There are no obvious abnormalities. I do not see any track marks or skin rashes or injection sites. LABORATORY DATA: Chest x-ray to my eyes is unremarkable. EKG showed first-degree AV block but otherwise is unremarkable. His blood gas showed a pH of 7.37, CO2 of 38, O2 of 179 and HCO3 of 21. He was on 50% O2 with that blood gas. His initial drug screen was negative."
2754,AV,arteriovenous,8. Hyperlipidemia. 9. Hypertension. 10.Chronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation. 11.The patient has a history of left ______ arterial bypass. The patient had AV fistula placed. 12.Multiple toe amputations. 13.Laparoscopic hysterectomy. MEDICATIONS: Medications were reviewed and is as stated in the Dr. _%#NAME#%_'s note.
2755,AV,atrioventricular,"NEUROLOGICALLY: She functions well. LABORATORY DATA: Is abnormal with the electrocardiogram showing a sinus rhythm with a first degree AV block. The blood work- up was normal with a cholesterol 241, but an HDL of 101. The basic metabolic panel did not get done. It is going to be done by _%#MMDD2004#%_."
2756,AV,atrioventricular,"LUNGS: Clear without wheezes, rhonchi or rales. ABDOMEN: Rounded, soft, non-tender without hepatosplenomegaly. EXTREMITIES: Trace edema of the ankles EKG shows sinus bradycardia with first degree AV block. Q-waves in V1 and V2. TSH is elevated at 11.7, INR is 1.03. Sodium is 132, potassium is 4.7. Chloride is 98, bicarb is 27, BUN is 38, creatinine is 1.63, glucose is 108."
2757,AV,atrioventricular,ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Loss of consciousness and right hip hematoma. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Loss of consciousness and right hip hematoma. Intermittent first degree AV block. HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. _%#NAME#%_ did well during her hospital stay.
2758,AV,atrioventricular,"This study was stopped on Saturday, red today. This study revealed now sinus rhythm with first degree with periods of second-degree Wenckebach AV conduction and periods of third degree-complete heart block with sinus rhythm at 75 and no QRS with 5-7.7 second pauses. There were isolated VPCs and junctional beats. The PR interval when in sinus rhythm showed first degree AV block, with episodes of 5-4, 4-3 and 3-2 AV conduction. Remarkably, despite these arrhythmias, he did not have symptoms and from Friday to Saturday he does not remember any chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, shortness of breath, orthopnea or lower leg edema."
2759,AV,arteriovenous,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is an 83-year-old gentleman presenting with lower gastrointestinal bleed while on warfarin. 1. Lower gastrointestinal bleed. At this time I would like to believe this is possibly secondary to AV malformation, diverticular or unclear etiology. Will hold warfarin after we check the INR. If need be will reverse him, but at this time I am disinclined to do that."
2760,AV,atrioventricular,"Full gait was not assessed. LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 132, potassium 5.9, chloride 107, CO2 19, BUN 87, creatinine 2.05, glucose 130, calcium 9.1. WBC 10.3, hemoglobin 12.2, platelets 153. EKG shows sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia, right bundle branch block and a first-degree AV block. Occasional PVCs. T-wave inversions consistent with a right bundle branch block and unchanged from _%#MM#%_. In the emergency room, the patient has been given a dose of Imodium 4 mg p.o. along with Kayexalate 15 grams p.o. and normal saline hydration prior to my arrival per Dr. _%#NAME#%_'s orders."
2761,AV,arteriovenous,She has not had any previous history of MI. She had a previous cardiac work-up quite a few years ago as part of a study. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. Vascular renal transplant times three. 2. AV malformation. 3. Partial right pneumonectomy. 4. Splenectomy. 5. Appendectomy. MEDICATIONS: 1. CellCept 1000 mg PO b.i.d. 2. Gengraf 75 mg b.i.d.
2762,AV,arteriovenous,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. End stage renal disease. 2. Initiation of maintenance hemodialysis. 3. Status post ligation of left AV fistula secondary to Steal Syndrome. 4. Long-standing hypertension. 5. Diabetes. 6. Ingrown toenail. 7. Left-sided pleural effusion on chest x-ray.
2763,AV,atrioventricular,"I highly doubt the possibility of a tachycardia-mediated problem. There is no other suggestion of risk for tachycardia such as ventricular tachycardia with normal LV function and no history of coronary artery disease. Based on the presence of trifascicular block, including first degree AV block, right bundle branch block, and left anterior fascicular block, he clearly has conduction system disease and is at significant risk for bradyarrhythmia."
2764,AV,atrioventricular,"In addition, the patient will follow up in Pacer Clinic in one week's time for staple removal in order to increase his lower rhythm from 60-70. His AV delay will be kept at 300 msec to allow _______ conduction. There is actually significant latency in the atrial lead and the patient's PR interval measured from onset of his atrial electrocardiogram, and his 12-lead is actually much less than 300 msec."
2765,AV,atrioventricular,"She is probably going to go home to her daughter's house now for the next two days and follow up with therapy recommendations, as well as her primary physician. I am giving her aspirin not coumadin as her platelet count is good and she is at high risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation i.e. truly has chronic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation but is in 1 st degree AV block right now. PROCEDURES: Echocardiogram reveals mild to moderate mitral regurgitation with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal ejection fraction and mild pulmonary hypertension."
2766,AV,atrioventricular,"I believe this diminished energy is multifactorial including the high dose of diltiazem, her age, obesity, deconditioning, medication side effects and possibly her heart rate being a little too low. She has a left bundle branch and significant AV conduction system dysfunction. I think it is unlikely that we will be able to maintain and keep her in sinus rhythm."
2767,AV,atrioventricular,"He had previously been on multiple medications including: Phoslo, Megace, Coreg, Lasix, nitroglycerin, Nephrocaps, lisinopril, Paxil, hydralazine, Imdur, melatonin and Remeron. He has a history of colon cancer as well as peripheral vascular disease as above. He has had an AV shunt placed in the left arm in _%#MM#%_ of 2005. He has had a splenectomy and cholecystectomy and internal fixation of left ankle fracture."
2768,AV,atrioventricular,"NEUROLOGIC AND CUTANEOUS: Normal. The patient is 73. He was transferred due to concerns about: 1. New onset worsening angina. 2. AV conduction system dysfunction with first degree AV block, intermittent second degree AV block and left bundle branch block. The first issue was the angina. We are going to do an angiogram."
2769,AV,atrioventricular,CT scan head shows no hemorrhage or masses. 12-lead EKG shows sinus rhythm with rate in the 60s with first degree AV block and left bundle branch block. This is similar to an EKG from _%#MM2003#%_. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. This is 80-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease who presents following what appears to be a syncopal episode.
2770,AV,atrioventricular,"PULSES: Pedal pulses are intact. LABORATORY DATA: Preoperative labs are noted. Hemoglobin 14.3, potassium 4.2. Preoperative EKG reveals first degree AV block with a PR of 0.40. EKG otherwise is normal. The finding of the first degree AV block apparently is a new finding and the patient reports that his primary doctor plans to further evaluate this, i.e., with an echocardiogram."
2771,AV,arteriovenous,"Reviewing the CT scan performed in the Emergency Room does demonstrate moderate bilateral hydronephrosis, and so some element of obstruction is possible. He dialyzes via a right- sided internal jugular tunnel dialysis catheter. He has had previous attempts at AV fistulas both in the right wrist and the left upper arm. Both of these by today's exam appear to be no longer functioning."
2772,AV,atrioventricular,"Her evaluation included both cardiology consultation for mild troponin elevation, thought secondary to acute myocardial infarction due to fixed coronary artery disease and hemodynamic fluctuations. In addition, she was noted to have a complete AV block with junctional escape and heart rate in the range of 40-50. Cardiology was consulted on this basis. After consultation with the family, it was decided not to proceed with permanent pacemaker or any other further evaluation of her atherosclerotic coronary disease."

2777,AV,atrioventricular,His left ventricular function (LVH) was moderately depressed with an ejection fraction of about 40% by nuclear medicine test. He had about an 80% LAD stenosis and an occluded right coronary artery (RCA) and occluded AV circumflex. A large intermediate branch had minimal disease. The PDA and the distal circumflex vessels were small on angiography.
2778,AV,atrioventricular,"The electrophysiology study was capable of inducing SVT; it was due to typical AV nodal re-entry. Cryomapping succeeded in finding a location in which slow AV conduction could be blocked without affecting antegrade fast pathway conduction. At this location, three cold applications were applied, freezing to minus 70 degrees for 4 minutes."
2779,AV,atrioventricular,"In the one week prior to discharge the patient had several beats of PVCs, but did not have any sort of nonsustained runs of VT. Throughout her hospital stay the patient has also been noted to have a second degree AV block with intermittent bradycardia down to the 30's as well as atrial fib and atrial flutter. Flutter with variable blocks of 1 to 4/1 to 6."

ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on _%#MMDD2007#%_ for increased creatinine, a 10-pound weight gain and chronic diarrhea."
2781,AV,atrioventricular,"HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Atrial fibrillation. The patient was admitted for intravenous heparin bridging prior to AV nodal ablation. His Coumadin was stopped. Once his INR was normal, he was taken for AV nodal ablation by Dr. _%#NAME#%_. A total of 10 applications of radio frequency energy to the AV nodal area was done which resulted in complete heart block with junctional escape rhythm at ___ beats per minute."
2782,AV,atrioventricular,"The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. _%#NAME#%_. The patient was given glucose, IV Lasix, insulin, and he had had two preadmission doses of Kayexalate. His potassium level promptly fell into the high-normal range and his AV dissociation cleared. He maintained normal sinus rhythm throughout his hospital course. During the course of his evaluation he was found to have anemia with a low ferritin level and a low iron level."
2783,AV,atrioventricular,"NEUROLOGICAL: Alert and oriented times three. Blood pressure is symmetric in both arms. No focal neurologic deficits are noted on exam. EKG, sinus bradycardia with first degree AV block. Chest x-ray by report is clear. LABORATORY ASSESSMENT: Is remarkable for slight decreased hemoglobin which is chronic."
2784,AV,atrioventricular,"He was converted in the ER with two doses of adenosine and also had some magnesium supplementation downstairs. He was in normal sinus rhythm. He had Electrophysiology study with ablation the following day after which there was no further inducible AV nodal reentry, however, while down in the radiology department off monitor for his follow-up chest x-ray, the patient again developed some fluttering feeling palpitations and light headedness which quickly resolved."
2785,AV,arteriovenous,He is not able to elevate or depress the eye or intort or extort it. A fundus exam reveals a clear disk with a normal cup-disk ratio. The vessels appear normal with grade 2 AV nicking. There is no evidence of papilledema. The left eye is completely normal. The left eye has normal range of motion.

2787,AV,atrioventricular,She had bilateral renal artery stenosis on MRA in _%#MM2005#%_ which was not felt amenable to angioplasty or stent. She has been treated for hypertension with multiple different medications. She also has been treated recently with AV node ablation and single-chamber pacemaker implantation due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has a history of chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine of 2.5 to 2.8. She has had difficulty with adequate diuresis for the past six to seven months.
2788,AV,atrioventricular,"LABORATORY DATA: Chest x-ray is unremarkable. Electrocardiogram shows changes that could be compatible with previous inferior and septal infarction, although she has no history of such, there are certainly no acute changes of myocardial ischemia or infarction. She has a first degree AV block and left axis deviation. Her laboratory is remarkable only for some decrease in renal function, the creatinine for a person her age and size is actually significantly elevated at 1.4, estimated GFR is at 38 and that might even be a little high."
2789,AV,atrioventricular,"Additionally, the patient was also given amiodarone loading dose and started on amiodarone drip. The patient was noted to be in normal sinus rhythm later when seen by cardiology noted to be in a first-degree AV block with occasional pauses. Amiodarone was discontinued at that time. The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout the remainder of his hospital stay."
2790,AV,atrioventricular,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Syncope with documented high degree AV block. We have been asked to be involved in the care of _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, an 82-year-old woman who has previously been relatively healthy, who was admitted to the hospital after a syncopal spell last evening."
2791,AV,atrioventricular,Blood sugars will be monitored by the hospitalists. IMPRESSION: 1. Symptomatic paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia associated with AV conduction system dysfunction/sick sinus syndrome. 2. Tachycardia documented. No bradycardia noted. Treatment however is difficult without concern for promoting bradycardia.
2792,AV,arteriovenous,"She will need to return to see Dr. _%#NAME#%_ this week when she is off of her Coumadin completely for enteric cololysis to further look at her small bowel. Even if we do find out the cause, it may be an AV malformation or something that is not really amenable to repair.

The patient has been undergoing ultraviolet therapy for this but has not had any treatments recently. 3. Morbid obesity with a BMI of 55. 4. Severe degenerative joint disease affecting the bilateral knees."
2848,IB,(stage) IB,"Cone stitches were intact, and the cervix was small. Uterus small and mobile; no adnexal masses. This was confirmed by rectovaginal examination. ASSESSMENT AT CLINIC: IA2 versus IB cervical carcinoma. HOSPITAL COURSE: PROBLEM #1: Disease. The patient had IB1 squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, grade 2, with positive lymph-vascular space involvement on cone biopsy prior to admission."
2849,IB,(stage) IB,"GYNECOLOGY: Status post total abdominal hysterectomy, vaginal mucosa is soft and smooth with no palpable masses or nodules. ASSESSMENT: 56-year-old female with stage IB (T1b N0 M0) grade 3?? endometrioid adenocarcinoma, status post total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic and periaortic lymph node dissection _%#MMDD2004#%_."
2850,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,Physical exam at this time showed right upper lobe crackles and symmetric breath sounds throughout. PROCEDURES AND STUDIES: Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on _%#MMDD2007#%_ by Dr. _%#NAME#%_. Cultures from the BAL grew non lactose fermenting gram-negative rods and Aspergillus fumigatus. HOSPITAL COURSE: A PICC line was placed in the OR at the time of the bronchoscopy and BAL.
2851,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Influenza A: Because of the patient's infiltrate on his chest x-ray and full clinical recovery, bronchoscopy was performed and the BAL ultimately had a positive test for influenza A. Given the patient's immunosuppression and his transplant status, it was decided to go ahead and treat his influenza with Tamiflu for 5 days even though he had been developed symptoms many days before."
2852,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is aa 61-year-old gentleman status post bilateral single-lung transplant in _%#MM#%_ 2006 with possible right lower lobe pneumonia. 1. For the pneumonia, given the fact that he had a history of pseudomonas on a routine BAL performed on _%#MMDD#%_, the patient was started on dual coverage with Timentin and levofloxacin. I did review his cultures today, and his cultures revealed that his Pseudomonas was sensitive to Levofloxacin, and so we are going to change him to only one agent today."
2853,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Showed resolution of her lymphadenopathy. HOSPITAL COURSE: On admission the patient was placed on a combination of ciprofloxacin, Zithromax, Famvir, dapsone, Decadron, and ibuprofen. Bronchoscopy _%#MMDD2004#%_ with BAL was essentially negative with negative cultures. Hypoxia has gradually improved during hospital stay. O2 saturations on room air on date of discharge _%#MMDD2004#%_ ranged from 92 to 96%."
2854,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Immunoglobulin levels, IgG 1140 and normal, IgA 442 (normal 70-380), IgM was 274 (normal 60-265), and elevated IgE 1528 (0-114). This last is of unclear significance. There were a few fungal elements in the BAL; however, there were no CT signs of bronchiectasis suggestive of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. 4. The patient complained of right lower quadrant pain during admission."
2855,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"He was intubated on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004 for hypoxia despite high levels of oxygen on CPAP. The patient had a bronchoscopy which revealed alveolar hemorrhage. BAL cultures grew enterococcus, and the patient was on empiric coverage for enterococcus. No fungal etiology was determined. The patient developed a pneumothorax and had a chest tube placement."
2856,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"The bronchoscopy was performed on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, with the impression of hemoptysis with abnormal chest x-ray diffusely ectatic airway suggesting a left upper lobe source BAL of RUL in left upper lobe worsened. Recommendations from this procedure were to follow up in the culture results, and she will follow up with interventional radiology who did perform the angiography."
2857,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"4. Question for afterload reduction might be beneficial. 5. Possible right heart catheterization may be helpful to measure cardiac output, SVR, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, as well as PVR. 6. Bronchoscopy - to evaluate airway, a BAL of the right to rule out an infection given her interstitial process, transcarinal biopsy of the subcarinal lymph nodes to evaluate the etiology."
2858,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"The pulmonary team was involved in the care of this patient, and we did perform a CT of the chest, with the results reported above, as well as a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, as well as a pleural tap. Culture from blood from the BAL, as well as from the pleural tap were sent, as well as gram stain and AFB stain, and all of them did not grow any specific pathogen."
2859,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Follow closely. Continue his anticoagulation, not start Coumadin at this time. Depending on his progress, if he improves, he would not need further therapy but he may need a BAL in 72 hours which would be Monday, or biopsy including VAT biopsy which I outlined to the patient and family. This is a judgment decision at this time and we will be available on the weekend to reconsider the workup."
2860,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"A PPD was placed, which was positive. Induced sputum was attempted, but patient failed. At that point, pulmonary was consulted for bronchoscopy with BAL and AFB, based on bronchial lavage was negative. With mediastinal lymphadenopathy, it was decided to consult thoracic surgery for a mediastinoscopy for lymph node biopsy."
2861,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"The procedure went uneventful and since then, her kidney function has gradually improved. Problem #2: Pneumonia. The patient had bronchoscopy with BAL which showed moderate growth of MRSA. The patient continued to be on voriconazole and levofloxacin. We also treated her with vancomycin and aztreonam."
2862,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"6. RSV pneumonia requiring 3-week hospitalization and 2-week ventilator dependence (_%#MM#%_ 2005). 7. Gastrostomy with tube feeds. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Admission physical significant for temperature of 92 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse 90, blood pressure 91/50, oxygen saturation 96% on room air; mild crackles in the right lower lobe consistent with BAL on lung exam, severe neurological impairment, and increased tone. HOSPITAL COURSE: _%#NAME#%_ was admitted to the pediatric pulmonary service on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, following a bronchoscopy that revealed omega-shaped epiglottis, redundant arytenoids, laryngotracheomalacia, erythematous airway mucosa, and cloudy thick secretions that later grew MRSA and pseudomonas."
2863,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"1. Respiratory failure. This is resolving. a. Will continue the oxygen supplementation. b. Continue pulmonary rehabilitation. c. This patient is status post bronchoscopy and the BAL grew Candida albicans. The patient will complete her Voriconazole course. d. The patient will follow up with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in 2 weeks from now, and she will have a chest x-ray PA and lateral views 1 day before her appointment."
2864,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"On _%#MMDD2006#%_, the patient required intubation for respiratory failure. A bronchoscopy that was done showed a bloody fluid return. The BAL cultures have been negative. He was started on high-dose methylprednisolone for the treatment of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The patient was successfully intubated on _%#MMDD2006#%_. He was doing well and ambulating until _%#MMDD2006#%_ when he began to re-experience respiratory distress."
2865,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Blood cultures from _%#MMDD2007#%_, 1 of 2 Staph species. Chest x-ray _%#MMDD2007#%_ clear. IMPRESSION: 1. Candida in sputum not compatible with pathogen and more compatible with colonization. 2. Aspergillus in BAL. Her CT scan does not show pneumonia nor does her history suggestive of pneumonia upon admission, though there is some history of recent pneumonia and chronic cough for several years."
2866,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"1. Community acquired pneumonia. a. See discussion above. b. Standard cares with oxygen, IV antibiotics, blood cultures. c. If symptoms persist and fail to respond to stand treatment, consider BAL or assessment for pleural effusion by CT scan or ultrasound. 2. Chronic steroid use. She does not appear ill enough to warrant high dose steroids."
2867,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"5. Possible GI bleed. 6. Acute myocardial infarction. 7. Possible amyloidosis. 8. Decubitus ulcers. 9. Pelvic abscess. DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND PROCEDURES: 1. Bronchoscopy and BAL on _%#MMDD2005#%_. Per notes, bronchoscopy revealed blood coming from the left upper lobe; however, no active bleeding at the trach site was noted."
2868,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"The patient underwent bronchoscopy on _%#MMDD2007#%_ from which there has been no positive cultures. The bronchoscopy BAL was negative for RSV, influenza, CMV and nocardia. The Gram stain from the BAL showed no organisms with few PMNs. The patient also underwent a sputum culture on _%#MMDD2007#%_ with a Gram stain revealing mixed Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and moderate PMNs."
2869,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"(See separate bronchoscopy report.) In brief, this showed extrinsic compression, apical segment, left upper lobe, extrinsic compression, superior segment, left lower lobe. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and needle aspiration biopsies performed. Pathology did not reveal malignancy, but did show evidence for Candida, which was felt pathological as the patient is on chronic steroids."
2870,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Pulmonary infection of unclear etiology. PROCEDURES PERFORMED HERE IN HOSPITAL STAY: Bronchoscopy with BAL that showed normal flora to grow, CT scan of the chest showing increase in 3 bad opacities and ground-glass opacities bilaterally. INITIAL PRESENTATION: In brief, this is a 51-year-old male with history of AML M6 diagnosed in _%#MM2005#%_, status post NMA, DCU, CT of _%#MMDD2006#%_ which was complicated by grade II GVHD who had been complaining of shortness of breath and cough during the last 7 days previous to admission."
2871,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"CT scan of the chest revealed bilateral nodular consolidation at both lung bases with the right side being greater than the left side. The patient was started on Abelcet IV which he tolerated. He underwent bronchoscopy and BAL, however, all BAL cultures have remained negative. We therefore discussed with the patient the possibility of doing a thoracoscopic biopsy, however, after consultation with Thoracic Surgery team and some discussions with the patient, his wife, and his primary oncologist, Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, decided that the patient should remain on Abelcet and have a follow-up CT scan of the chest as an outpatient."
2872,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"His post transplant course was complicated by neutropenic fevers for which broader antifungal coverage of Vfend was begun. Also, a CT of the chest was obtained that was abnormal and a bronchoscopy was performed on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2004. BAL findings included gram stain showing mixed gram positive cocci and gram negative rods with culture growing heavy growth of coagulase negative Staph."
2873,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"2. Pneumonia: The patient was started at presentation on intravenous ciprofloxacin and Zosyn. He did respond well to the antibiotics. His BAL culture at this time is not growing any bacteria. However, because of his high risk given his immunosuppression and the presence of influenza, we felt that continuing his antibiotics through his followup visit with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, would be appropriate."
2874,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"2. Pulmonary infiltrates for at least several weeks, no clear response to antibiotics ongoing elevated white count for unclear reasons not having much cough currently and not that much change in the infiltrates, question involved in #1 and of course #3 below of significance 3. Actinomycosis grew in BAL from _%#MMDD#%_, this is a new diagnosis and not seen previously. This could be a simple colonizing organism but our actual clinical course immunocompromised status make this a quite possibly significant pathogen here."
2875,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"RELEVANT TESTS, PROCEDURES AND CONSULTATIONS DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION: 1. Bronchoscopy with BAL on _%#MMDD2007#%_, which was positive for Candida albicans and Gram-positive cocci, AFB stain was negative. There was no evidence of viral or other infectious etiologies. Cytology was negative for malignancy. 2. Repeat bronchoscopy with BAL on _%#MMDD2007#%_, which again showed wide growth of Candida albicans, however this time there was no evidence of other organisms or bacteria, seen on BAL."
2876,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"CSF has been negative for leukemia. The patient then presented to the BMT Clinic to discuss BMT options. During workup, CT scan of the chest revealed nodules in both lungs. A BAL was counted, with heavy growth of Candida albicans/glabrata and HSV. He was then started on voriconazole and Valtrex. VATS on _%#MMDD2006#%_ grew bacillus sensitive to Levaquin."
2877,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"We will go back to Levaquin seeing she had some response, as well as continue Rocephin. 3. Await current cultures and induced sputum. 4. Question bronchoscopy. Already did have a BAL in 2005 without evidence of a chronic organism such as AFB or fungi. Patient does not look that ill so how aggressive to be is difficult to tell."
2878,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"At transfer, she was switched from antibiotics to vancomycin, Rocephin and clindamycin and feels somewhat better at present. No obvious exposures. Had negative PPDs in the past. She has had a BAL done now, which preliminary results are showing some type of yeast form consistent with Aspergillus. It also is growing methicillin-resistant Staph aureus. She does have a bird and a cat she has been around, but no other definite animal exposures."
2879,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,The nasopharyngeal swab on _%#MMDD2005#%_ was negative for RSV. The bronchoscopy results were reviewed from _%#MMDD2005#%_: BAL was negative for CMV. RSV negative. AFB pending. Normal respiratory flora. Moderate growth of yeast. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a 59-year-old lady status post right single lung transplant status post COPD _%#MM2002#%_ was experiencing upper respiratory infection and recent bronchitis in the setting of bronchoscopy.
2880,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"An infectious disease consultation was requested. They recommended bronchoscopy to better determine the etiology of the patient's pneumonia. This was performed on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_. BAL Gram stain demonstrated no organisms and only few white blood cells. Cultures have been negative with the exception of Candida. However, in discussing the case with both pulmonary and infectious disease, they felt that given that the patient had been on antibiotics for several days when the bronchoscopy was performed, that PCP could not ruled out."
2881,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"PROBLEM #2: Lung transplant. On the day of admission and also 2 days prior to admission, was found to have a low Prograf levels at 4.4 and at 6.6. With increasing opacities in the CT scan, there was concern for acute rejection, especially in light of her recent episode of acute rejection. Hence, we proceeded with doing a bronchoscopy, BAL and transbronchial biopsy. The transbronchial biopsy was suggestive of resolving infection than acute rejection and her immunosuppressive therapy was continued and adjusted with a goal Prograf level of 10 was achieved prior to discharge."
2882,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"We discussed starting Valtrex 1 g daily as prophylaxis, however, the patient was reluctant to add another medication and would like to discuss this in an outpatient setting. Pending the results of the BAL cultures, further treatment will be determined either for infection or chronic graft-versus-host disease. The patient completed weaning off of Gengraf on _%#MMDD#%_ and will continue on 60 mg prednisone daily for now."
2883,BAL,blood alcohol level,"The patient had suicidal ideation and plan to jump off University of Minnesota bridge. He threw his bike over the bridge and decided to walk to _%#COUNTY#%_ _%#COUNTY#%_ Medical Center instead where in the emergency room he had a BAL 0.04. During his hospital course at Fairview-University Medical Center, the patient showed a rapid improvement and denied any suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, or psychosis by day #2 of his stay."
2884,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Initially, the patient had bilateral pleural effusions and then had bilateral chest tubes placed for draining of the fluid. The patient also had a bronchoscopy with BAL which grew Pseudomonas and group D enterococcus. The patient was started on the antibiotics levofloxacin, ceftazidime, TOBI nebs, and vancomycin, and reduced but continued to have fevers."
2885,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"2. Multiple myeloma, lambda light chain restricted. 3. Acute and chronic renal insufficiency. 4. History of right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. 5. Single colony of filamentous fungus on BAL. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, lambda light chain stage IIA, who also has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, gout, anemia, history of a right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis."
2886,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"The vocal cords moved normally. The trachea was of normal caliber. The bronchial mucosa and the anatomy were normal. There were no endobronchial lesions and no secretions. BAL was performed. 3. BAL fluid analysis. The Gram-stain on the BAL grew few gram-positive cocci and clusters, few gram-negative rods and few PMNs."
2887,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"Postoperatively, she developed acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. She was intubated for about 2 weeks. Bronchoscopy showed negative BAL cultures. She was treated empirically with vancomycin, imipenem and ganciclovir. Amylase and lipase levels were found to be increasing. This was thought to be secondary to mild pancreatitis. She underwent induction chemotherapy with Thymoglobulin and prednisone."
2888,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"LUNGS: There are crackles in the left-lower lobe. His I to E ratio is 1:1. ABDOMEN: Benign. SKIN: Clear. ADMISSION LAB DATA: A BAL culture grew out Staphylococcus aureus, which is MSSA. Acid-fast bacilli were 1+ and moderate growth of Aspergillus fumigatus. Negative for mycoplasma, negative for CMV, influenza and RSV. His CBC and BMP are within normal limits."
2889,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"The patient initially received Zosyn, Cipro, and vancomycin for a presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia. A BAL was done to evaluate for infection as well as confirm malignancy. This BAL cultures grew out coag-negative staph sensitive to agents the patient was previously on. The cytological evaluation of the BAL demonstrated adenocarcinoma but no organisms or other signs of infection."
2890,BAL,blood alcohol level,In the setting of alcohol excess consisting of 5 beers and 2 Bloody Mary's. 911 was called. The police transport of the patient to the ER (as above). BAL of 0.137.

HOSPITAL COURSE: Pneumonia."
2892,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"We again repeated the CT on _%#MMDD2007#%_ which showed worsening CT scan with extensive air space opacities in both lungs. We performed a BAL on _%#MMDD2007#%_ which had a light growth of Fusarium. We started caspofungin at this time. Again, this BAL grew out VRE and we started linezolid."
2893,BAL,blood alcohol level,"ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: She was on Propranolol which was recently prescribed by a doctor for tremor but she was not honest with the doctor about how much she was drinking and thus she may have been having some withdrawal tremor at the time of the visit. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission, her physical examination was essentially normal. LABORATORY: BAL 0.46 on admission. AST 731, GGT 867 and GGT 166. Bilirubin was normal. HOSPITAL COURSE: During the course of this hospital stay she was given Ativan for withdrawal and did fairly well."
2894,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"The patient continued to have fever with bilateral infiltrates until _%#MMDD2004#%_. PROBLEM #2: Respiratory failure: He underwent a bronchoscopy and BAL on _%#MMDD2004#%_ to evaluate for the etiology for his respiratory failure.

BAL of 0.3, the patient's second DWI. He was taken to Fairview Southdale Hospital where the patient allegedly complained of abdominal discomfort."
2898,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"He was subsequently seen by Nephrology Consult Team which adjusted his diuretic medications. He was also noted to have hemoptysis and subsequently underwent bronchoscopy with BAL culture growing CMV and pseudomonas species after which he was placed on appropriate antibiotics. Other significant issue during this hospital course was that he had melena, for which an EGD was obtained on _%#MMDD2007#%_."
2899,BAL,bronchoalveolar lavage,"The lung volumes were reduced, indicating a restrictive pattern which could be due to the patient's decreased neuromuscular status. The bronchoscopy was performed on _%#MMDD2006#%_, which showed normal-appearing anatomic structures with unresolving bilateral infiltrates.

2953,FSH,follicle-stimulating hormone,"However, she was not placed on seizure medications at this point, as this may be just a nonspecific finding.

Irregular vaginal bleeding with endometrial biopsy and laboratory evaluation normal to date.
2968,FSH,Fairview Southdale Hospital,He is on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. His last fall was several days ago. He was seen in the ER here at FSH two days ago and released. His wife found him unresponsive this morning and was brought into the ER here at FSH. He had emesis. A head CT was obtained and neurosurgical consultation was requested.
2969,FSH,follicle-stimulating hormone,"The patient is overall hemodynamically stable currently, and so I do not feel that acute hydrocortisone/dexamethasone therapy is necessary. In the morning, we will repeat thyroid studies, and check FSH, LH, and a cosyntropin stimulation test. 3. Diabetes mellitus, type 2, insulin-dependent. Recent A1C was 8.0. If the patient is eating better, reduce insulin doses and cover in addition with sliding scale."
2970,FSH,follicle-stimulating hormone,"Admission was complicated by diaphoresis. The patient was evaluated by Endocrine and found to have a decreased a.m. Cortisol with normal ACTA stem test.

2972,FSH,follicle-stimulating hormone,"ASSESSMENT: 1. Multiple sclerosis exacerbation. 2. Drenching night sweats for four years. Etiology of this is not clear. The patient did have an FSH level which was low normal, suggesting that she is not menopausal. The differential for her night sweats may include: a. Autonomic instability related to MS."
2973,FSH,follicle-stimulating hormone,"Her history dated back a few years when she started to have her menses every 22 to 26 days with heavy flow, with moderate to severe dysmenorrhea, menorrhea relieved with analgesics and she works in a school and she had to take four days off each month during her menses. She has had endometrial biopsy which was negative and TSH FSH were normal. Hemoglobin was 12.3. Endometrial biopsy was negative. She was treated with cyclic Provera therapy which did not resolve dysmenorrhea or menorrhagia."
2974,FSH,Fairview Southdale Hospital,"He was placed on antibiotics with resolution of the discomfort, however, he began vomiting blood. He also became dizzy and went into the ER at FSH. He was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. Prior to any definitive anticoagulation, it was recommended that he have his symptomatic tooth removed."
2975,FSH,follicle-stimulating hormone,"Her cycles are regular, occurring every 28 days. Her flow lasts for approximately 5 days, then stops for a couple of days and then resumes again for 3-5 days. Both consist of heavy menstrual flow. She has had a hormonal evaluation which revealed normal FSH and estradiol levels. Ultrasound revealed an enlarged uterus with at least 5 fibroids one of which appears to have butt against the endometrial cavity."
2976,FSH,follicle-stimulating hormone,"The patient is menopausal at age 38 and thus for five years has been on menopause replacement. She has opted for birth control pills and had an FSH of 102 back at age 38. She has done well for the last two years on birth control pills. She is a non-smoker and understands the risks. She takes baby aspirin, calcium and started having anemia secondary to menorrhagia approximately six months ago."

3116,C3,(complement) component 3,"I suspect he has underlying renal artery stenosis, but I would not expect it to progress this fast. He also has no flank pain or other complaints for infarction. The plan will be to check ASO, anti-DNase B, C3, C4, FANA, ANCA, and anti-GBM antibody. We will consult Renal for further evaluation and possible kidney biopsy. 2. Hypertension: We have obviously held his lisinopril. Currently, he has been started on clonidine and should probably add in calcium channel blockers, such as amlodipine to that and discontinue his atenolol, as he has developed first-degree AV block and some bradycardia with the very high dose of atenolol for his renal insufficiency."
3117,C3,(complement) component 3,"She has lupus nephritis. She was previously treated with Imuran and prednisone, Cytoxan and prednisone and high-dose Imuran and prednisone. Previous treatments have all been ineffective. She started CellCept _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2002, and has had some improvement in C3 and C4 since. She was well until approximately 5 days prior to admit. At that time, she was in Europe at the end of a 2-week choir trip and she began to have emesis x3."

Cranial Nerve 8: Hearing intact bilaterally. Cranial Nerve 9 through 12: The uvula elevates midline, the tongue protrudes midline."
3121,C3,cervical (level) 3,"It was noted that when looking at the scans from early _%#MM#%_ to the present, there does appear to be incremental increase in the amount of slippage between C2 and C3. The anterior aspect of the ring at C1 appears to be slightly more anterior than clivus and is normal. Of critical note is when working at the base of her skull, there appears to be a fracture through the base of the clivus."
3122,C3,(complement) component 3,"On admission, the patient's protein-to-creatinine ratio was 0.95. It peaked at 2.5 and then by the time of discharge it was back down to 0.74. With respect to her compliment levels she was admitted with a C3 of 67 and a C4 of 17 and on discharge her C3 was 88 and her C4 was 19. Antidouble stranded DNA was 125 on admission and 77 on discharge. At the time of discharge it was thought that her Zoster as well as her periorbital cellulitis had become close enough to resolution that it would be safe to restart her CellCept at her previous dose and continue her prednisone at the dose that was maintained during her hospitalization."
3123,C3,cervical (level) 3,"HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Neurological: After thorough evaluation, the diagnosis of Guillain- Barre syndrome was discarded and instead, through MRI and physical examination, a diagnosis of C3 through C6 incomplete tetraplegia was determined. Neurosurgery took the patient to the OR and did a C3 through C6 cervical laminectomy. The paraspinal abscess was positive for staph aureus. On presentation he had significant forelimb paraplegia and sensory abnormalities with decreased pin prick below T4 on the right and below C7 on the left."
3124,C3,(complement) component 3,"She has been subsequently seen not only by her primary care physician, Dr. _%#NAME#%_, but also by rheumatologist, Dr. _%#NAME#%_. Additional lab studies include negative ASO titer, normal levels of C3 and C4, normal serum protein electrophoresis, a second sedimentation rate obtained four days ago elevated to 38, a simultaneous C-reactive protein elevated to 5.28.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 56-year-old right- handed white male who was transferred from the VA Medical Center for workup of cervical myelopathy and radiculopathy."
3127,C3,(complement) component 3,"She previously underwent workup and was found to have a negative ANA, normal total compliment level, and a normal C4 level. Her C3 level was decreased on two occasions to 77 mg/dL and 76 mg/dL in _%#MM2003#%_ and _%#MM2003#%_ respectively. This suggests a defect in the patient's immune system. Given that the patient is doing well clinically on Singulair and Zyrtec, with no episodes of angioedema since her last visit at this clinic, we will not pursue evaluation of the patient's alternatives at this point."
3128,C3,(complement) component 3,"On _%#MMDD2007#%_, her urine was negative for protein at that time. She has had a C4, which was 14 on _%#MMDD2007#%_ and C3, which was 93. Both were low normal.

3131,C3,(complement) component 3,"She clearly does not have any other symptoms or findings that would support this diagnosis, but since a thorough evaluation has not yielded any etiology of the organic brain syndrome, it is certainly reasonable to look a bit more with some blood tests. PLAN: 1. Further laboratory studies to include repeat FANA, SSA and SSB antibodies, extractable nuclear antigens, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, C3 and C4 levels. We will also check serum protein electrophoresis with immunoelectrophoresis. 2. Await CT scan, lumbar puncture and blood results. 3. No treatment is recommended at this time."

Her diagnosis was initially made by an abnormal newborn screen with an elevated C3 with also elevated methylmalonic acid in the newborn bloodspot. Confirmatory tests sent by her primary care physician at Health Partners, Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, revealed that her urine organic acids had a methylmalonic acid of 3000, low serum carnitine, and low plasma carnitine."
3135,C3,cervical (level) 3,"The only difference noted on the exam of the left arm is slight numbness to light touch in the left thumb. There is some tenderness around C3 through C5 palpation of the spine and left paraspinous musculature. Additionally, there is some tenderness in the left trapezius and left deltoid."
3136,C3,(complement) component 3,"Infectious cause was also another possibility; however, her CRP remained low throughout her hospital stay. In addition, her FANA, ANCA and complement were normal. Of note, her C3 was low-normal at 77; her C4 was 17. In treatment for acute renal failure which developed the night of _%#MMDD2004#%_ with a creatinine rise to 3.43 and a BUN of 61, she was begun on hemodialysis."

Once these studies have been completed, would then consider referring patient to a geneticist at the University of Minnesota for further evaluation."
3138,C3,cervical (level) 3,The patient's low back and neck pain began due to an injury in 1993 when he worked as a firefighter and carried an 11-year-old child down multiple flights of stairs. In 1993 he had surgery to replace C2 and C3 at Mercy Hospital. Approximately 5 weeks ago the patient had back surgery to fuse L4 and L5.

3142,C3,(complement) component 3,"The patient had glucose monitoring, the highest was 336. The glucose dropped to 141 as soon as the TPN was discontinued, although she is still on prednisone 40 mg twice a day. On _%#MMDD#%_ EKG was normal. BMP showed a glucose of 156, ANA was weakly positive at 2.7. Complement C3 was down to 42, C4 was slightly low at 11. Total complement was low at 29. Double stranded DNA was negative. On _%#MMDD#%_ blood type was O positive. Followup chest x-ray was normal."
3143,C3,(complement) component 3,"This has not occurred to date. The patient has carried a diagnosis of a ""lupus-like"" syndrome in the past. She has seen one of my partners. She has been known to have mild elevation of FANA and slight depression of C3 complement. She has had mild elevations of cardiolipin antibodies on at least one occasion. Her creatinine had been stable in the past. She has had arthralgias and low-grade arthritis and was treated with Plaquenil up until about a year ago."
3144,C3,cervical (level) 3,"At that time she had a CT of her chest, abdomen and pelvis which showed some lesions in her liver and kidney. She also had an MRI of her cervical and thoracic spine, which showed some increased hypointensity in C3, C7, and T5.

This has been complicated with apparent fluid collections around the surgical site, compressing the spinal cord, requiring drainage on two separate occasions."
3146,C3,cervical (level) 3,"PROCEDURES PERFORMED: MRI of the spine without contrast. This showed the cervical vertebrae appeared normally aligned. There was no evidence of a fracture of the cervical spine. There was large anterior osteophyte formation at C3, C4 and C5. There was narrowing of the disk height of C4 to C5, C5 to C6, and C6 to C7, and C7 to T1 is demonstrated."
3147,C3,cervical (level) 3,OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES: 1. MRI cervical spine with and without contrast: Impression: New myelopathic signal within the spinal cord at C3-C4 due to severe degenerative disease with superimposed congenital narrowing of the canal. Dorsal epidural space enhancement at C3 through C7 due to either venous congestion or infection/inflammation. Enhancement in C4-C5 vertebral bodies likely due to severe discogenic changes unchanged from outside MRI.
3148,C3,cervical (level) 3,"There are active areas of demyelination. On the cervical spine MRI, this was a limited exam secondary to patient motion, but there is probable abnormal T2 signal hyperintensity within the cervical spinal cord, likely related to the multiple sclerosis. The T2 signal hyperintensity is present in multiple areas between C3 and C6 levels. There is no abnormal contrast enhancement within the cervical spinal cord. The patient was continued on her Betaseron and Fampridine at the beginning of the admission."
3149,C3,(complement) component 3,"Of note, his C3 level was low at 17 on admission and rose over the course of his stay to a high of 73 on discharge. This is still low for C3 level. DNase B antibody was only mildly elevated at 170 on admission and doubled by _%#MMDD#%_ at 340. This indicated that the patient had been exposed to strep."
3150,PT,physical therapy,"4. Nutritional issues and dysphagia: He has a feeding tube, however, speech therapy is working with patient and will continue to do swallow studies.

Normal saline fluids to rehydrate patient. 9. DNR/DNI. This was reconfirmed with the daughter."
3152,PT,physical therapy,"A urinalysis was negative for leukocyte esterase or nitrates, but was noted to have greater than 100,000 bacteria. ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 1. Cerebral vascular accident. Plan is for PT, OT, nutrition, tube feeds, and general reconditioning. We will continue the patient's Plavix and we will hold the aspirin because of his recent small intracerebral hemorrhage and his generalized increased bleeding risk at this time."
3153,PT,physical therapy,"They have agreed to provide ongoing care and support for him at home. He will be followed by HealthPartners home care including a home RN, PT, OT.

Will obtain PT and OT evaluations and treatment. 4. Social Service evaluation for transitional care unit placement; the patient probably needs long-term care as I believe she is very marginal for continued independent living despite the assisted living."
3160,PT,physical therapy,"4. Dementia; I question whether she has dementia. I think she needs a psychiatric evaluation. She will need placement and probably PT, OT evaluations as well. 5. Hypertension; we will watch her blood pressures; if they start to be elevated we will then treat. 6. Tobacco dependence. Smoking cessation. Part two job"
3161,PT,physical therapy,She otherwise was in stable condition and was transferred to rehabilitation.

3167,PT,physical therapy,8. Activity: As tolerated. Assist the patient with eating. HOSPITAL COURSE: PROBLEM #1: Weakness; dehydration. Ms. _%#NAME#%_ was admitted to the floor. She was rehydrated with IV fluids. PT and OT were consulted. Her history in the last two or three months has been one of repeated hospitalizations.
3168,PT,physical therapy,"The patient was admitted to the station for observation. On the station, the patient's further hospital course was uneventful. He gradually improved and started feeling more confident and stronger. He was started on PT and actually did very well. He was walking with a walker and his confidence improved and he started feeling stronger."
3169,PT,physical therapy,We will hold on that at this time due to the fact that she may be a surgical candidate and we will follow up. Other things I would recommend to keep this patient's pain managed during the time that she is waiting for a second opinion for surgery is to have PT followup and do a TENS unit which she has used in the past and does want have one at home so if they can reactivate that TENS therapy for her back that would be helpful as well.
3170,PT,physical therapy,"5. Diabetes. 6. Hypertension. 7. Deconditioning. The patient due to a prolonged hospitalization did develop quite severe deconditioning and will be transferred for PT and OT to _%#CITY#%_ Care Center. 8. Anemia and GI bleed.

3173,PT,physical therapy,"Weightbearing is currently none. Activity level is advance as tolerated. Care level is skilled. Rehabilitation potential is fair. Code status is full. The patient will require PT, OT, and speech therapy assistance. The patient is on .....FIO2 per trach dome. Tube feeding is impact with glutamine at 60 cc/hour."
3174,PT,physical therapy,"She made minimal progress in PT and was not able to return to independent or semi-independent living and was therefore discharged to a nursing home for ongoing care. She will receive PT and OT there. She is in stable condition, but is now requiring oxygen, low flow at 1 to 2 liters to maintain her saturations in the 90s."
3175,PT,physical therapy,She tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to transitional care unit for rehabilitation HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient received OT and PT. She tolerated this well.

The patient expressed her wishes of DNR/DNI during this interview and her son was in the room who concurred with the patient.
3182,PT,physical therapy,"She also required inpatient rehab 5 years ago after a brain tumor resection. PT, OT, and Speech Therapy have been consulted. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. History of multiple cardiovascular accidents with residual left facial droop."
3183,PT,physical therapy,"Secondary to his other chronic medical processes including a previous CVI with dementia, obesity, coronary disease, osteoarthritis the patient was no longer able to care for himself and had lost his abilities in the activities of daily living. The patient was seen and evaluated by physical therapy, occupational therapy and social service and it was determined the most appropriate situation would be transitional care with continued PT and OT to try to regain skills in the activities of daily living and ambulation. The patient is transferred to a TCU for this. The patient additionally had periods of sedation and some mild agitation; this is related to the previous CVI and dementia and possibly underlying developing senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type."
3184,PT,physical therapy,"PT, OT evaluations were accomplished. It was felt the patient required rehabilitation before returning home and thus he is transferred to a TCU. It is asked that PT, OT and speech therapy evaluate and treat the patient. It is asked that the patient be fitted for TED hose, thigh high, which is hopeful to prevent syncopal episodes in the future."
3185,PT,physical therapy,"I think this is probably due to the hydrochlorothiazide or Hydrodiuril and this will be held. We will cautiously give the patient some saline, watching for congestive heart failure. Also, we will get a PT and OT evaluation. Discussions with the husband and the daughter indicate that the patient may have to be placed in a nursing home facility."
3186,PT,physical therapy,"She is up ambulating and holding onto her IV pole to the bathroom with standby assist. She was seen by PT and OT today. On PT evaluation, she was independent with bed mobility, sit to stand, and back. She was standby assistance chair to bed and back. She was standby assistance for gait."
3187,PT,physical therapy,"Therefore, the patient has been deemed appropriate for discharge to home. She will be transferred to a nursing home for convalescence. She will be discharged with routine ostomy cares and request for PT and OT evaluation. The patient will be discharged on her outpatient medications along with the addition of, 1. Compazine 5 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. 2. Bisacodyl suppositories p.r.n. daily."
3188,PT,physical therapy,5. Debility. The patient's functional status may be at significant risk for decline postoperatively given multiple comorbidities that may make it difficult for her to successfully rehabilitate and become ambulatory again after surgery. This needs to be determined pending her course with PT and OT involved as will be routine postoperatively. Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this complex patient and family's care.
3189,PT,physical therapy,"Some voluntary guarding. Difficult to get a good examination. GU: Pelvic and rectal deferred. EXTREMITIES: No cervical or axillary femoral nodes. Femoral pulses present.

3190,PT,physical therapy,"She has had multiple falls at home secondary to difficulty walking as well as some of her vertigo, which occasionally does occur. She was transferred to rehab from the hospital for pain control as well as PT and OT. Today, upon questioning the patient, she complains of severe pain, 10/10, on her left buttocks, extending down the back of her leg, with numbness down the back of her leg as well from her buttocks down to her foot."
3191,PT,physical therapy,"The duodenal bulb, the second part of the duodenum were normal. The patient was discharged back to the floor. She was placed on iron. She was also seen by OT and PT. Dr. _%#NAME#%_ noted that the patient was obstipated and treated her with a regimen of Colace, Metamucil, Sorbitol, and had the ET nurse irrigate her colostomy site."
3192,PT,physical therapy,"This has been done at the hospital for the last two days and seems to have work well. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: Discharge diet is 1800 calorie ADA diet. We have asked PT, OT and Speech Therapy to evaluate and work with the patient. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d."
3193,PT,physical therapy,"She denies any neck pain for now, though she carries a history of C-spine arthritis. PT, OT and speech evaluation have been recommended and are in process. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation consult has been requested per protocol."
3194,PT,physical therapy,"2. Weakness. This is secondary to pneumonia, we will have PT/OT. Family hopes to be able to take him home possibly with home PT as needed, as he does have a daytime caregiver. 3. Tinea pedis. I will treat him with ketoconazole cream to his feet."
3195,PT,physical therapy,"DISCHARGE PLAN: She was discharged to home on postoperative day #2 with the following medications, Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o. q. 4-6 hours p.r.n. pain. She was instructed to resume her preoperative medications. She will have home health nurse and home PT evaluation."
3196,PT,physical therapy,She had some falls at home due to her weakness and so we got a femur x-ray which showed the possibility of a fracture but followup MRI did not confirm this. She was not quite ready to go back home at the end of this admission so she was transferred over to the Fairview Transitional Care services for more PT and OT. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Viagra 25 mg PO t.i.d. for peripheral vascular disease.
3197,PT,physical therapy,"3. Delirium and dementia. The patient had an OT evaluation, but however the patient has been very stable all throughout her hospital course and she has maintained a fair cognitive function and she has been pretty oriented and alert. PT and OT was consulted and at the time of discharge as per PT the patient is up with minimal supervision to independent, she ambulated 400 inches with walker and did 6 steps with supervision."
3198,PT,physical therapy,"Will place on empiric alcohol withdrawal protocol. 5. Depression. Patient agrees to Psychiatry and Social Work consults. 6. Hypothyroidism. Will check TFTs. 7. Disposition: Will obtain PT, OT and Social Work consults."
3199,PT,physical therapy,"I in addition cannot rule out a peripheral neuropathy, however, at this point in time, the most important thing is to get OT and PT to evaluate and consult, falls precautions. The patient has possibly got some kind of progressive issues which may not be able to treat at this point in time."

3283,IR,interventional radiology,"The chest tube was pulled on _%#MMDD2007#%_. The patient was followed with daily chest x-rays, which showed a persistent left hydropneumothorax. At the time of his discharge surgery did not want to address the persistent hydropneumothorax and suggested that perhaps IR could be consulted to place a pigtail drain. Throughout his hospital course the patient remained stable on room air and did not develop any respiratory distress."
3284,IR,interventional radiology,"PROBLEM #6: GU: She does have a history of stage III chronic kidney disease with a creatinine of 1.65. Left hydroureter found intraop with renal ultrasound showing a 5-mm cortex of left kidney, likely longstanding. Neither IR nor Renal recommended a stent or PNT placement. Her renal function was stable at the time of discharge. Her Foley catheter was removed on _%#MMDD2007#%_ and she was voiding spontaneously."
3285,IR,interventional radiology,"His bilirubin on admission was 6.5 and during the course of the hospital stay, it went down to 4.3. His amylase and lipase were normal, and his alkaline phosphatase is running around 700 which is hyper for his normal. He was switched from IV Timentin to p.o. Augmentin, and he will be discharged to follow up in 2 weeks for pancreatic duct removal and to make an appointment with _%#NAME#%_ at _%#TEL#%_ and also followup labs Mondays and Thursdays to follow up his bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase and if things are not getting any better in the next couple of weeks, he will be readmitted for a cholangiogram percutaneous by IR."

3287,IR,immediate-release,"I had the hospitalist see him for that purpose but he basically did well. We had some problems with pain control. We got that corrected as well with the use of oxycodone IR, and at the time of discharge he was eating, and his wounds were clean and dry. For a list of discharge medications, please see the discharge summary."
3288,IR,interventional radiology,"The effusion appears minimal and the patient is relatively asymptomatic at this time. However, if it increases, may consider discussing with IR to obtain a thoracentesis. 2. BMT day +20 status post auto transplant. Counts are increasing. She is off GCSF. Platelets are low, however, and we will do frequent platelet checks to keep counts greater than 50,000."
3289,IR,interventional radiology,"She underwent diagnostic tap which showed a relatively bland fluid and no evidence of malignancy. In addition, there was no evidence of infection. After undergoing tap at the bedside, she underwent more thorough drainage with an IR guided paracentesis that removed 4.5 liters. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Creon 5 one tab p.o. with meals."
3290,IR,interventional radiology,"Despite any risks of Greenfield filter placement, the patient wishes to be protected against pulmonary embolism. I will ask IR to place the Greenfield filter. The patient's Lovenox will be held until the Greenfield filter is placed. The patient should have both Lovenox and Greenfield filter. I will start the patient on heparin if he cannot have a Greenfield filter placed today."
3291,IR,interventional radiology,"An ultrasound of her pancreas transplant was obtained which showed a small fluid collection surrounding the transplant pancreas with normal arteriovenous flow. She had a percutaneous biopsy of her pancreas transplant by IR, which was a small sample unable to show evidence of rejection or CMV infection or pancreatitis. Therefore, the patient was treated with 500 mg of Solu- Medrol intravenously X3 doses for clinically diagnosed rejection induced pancreatitis."
3292,IR,interventional radiology,The GI physician contacted me to admit the patient after the procedure. I saw the patient in his room on the sixth floor after the IR procedure. The patient presented to _%#CITY#%_ Hospital yesterday evening with some abdominal pain.
3293,IR,interventional radiology,"Check CRP. I did discuss the case with GI and conservative management for now until pseudocysts form maybe better. We might need to talk to IR tomortow to see if they recommend drainage once our CT here is obtained. IR is unable to review the scan ay CDI _%#CITY#%_ _%#CITY#%_. I suspect this fluid explains her bloating. 2. For gentle bloating and distention, we will check a Clostridium difficile and stool studies."
3294,IR,interventional radiology,"A Renal consult was also obtained at that time to ensure proper management of the patient's renal failure and to assist the need for dialysis. Bilateral PNTs were then placed per Renal and IR recommendations and the patient had a post-obstructed diuresis. The patient's creatinine slowly decreased. However, she had multiple problems with recurrent infections and dysfunction in the PNTs throughout her hospital stay necessitating the replacement by IR several times."
3295,IR,interventional radiology,"The patient denied any abdominal pain, fevers, or chills postprocedure and was noted admitted for further observation overnight. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Status post occlusion of hepatic artery performed by IR. After discussion with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ in interventional radiology, it sounded like the procedure went very well. The plan was to have a followup ultrasound the following day to make sure that the shunt was in place and that the fistula was actually cleaned off."
3296,IR,interventional radiology,"PROBLEM #4: Hip fracture. There was concern that the fluid seen around his hip on his abdomen and pelvic CT represented joint infection. Therefore, Orthopedic Surgery was consulted and x-rays were obtained and IR performed a CT-guided aspirate of the joint fluid. However, this fluid was cultured and did not grow any organisms. Orthopedics felt that the avulsion fracture of the greater trochanter was not a cause for infection, nor was it a cause for his pain."
3297,IR,interventional radiology,She was tolerating a regular diet at the time of discharge. 5. GI: Constipation medications were given to prevent constipation. 6. GU: The patient was taken by IR to the OR and bilaterally JJ ureteral stents were placed. A Foley was in and blood-tinged urine was noted at the time of discharge.
3298,IR,interventional radiology,"1. Bleeding/oozing at a central venous insertion site with a drop in hemoglobin to 6.9; it had been approximately 8 prior to discharge. Will try and infuse 3 units, give the patient DDAVP and will contact IR for local application of Destat patch around the entry site. If bleeding continues, would consider either cryos or FFP and possibly platelet transfusion as well."
3299,IR,interventional radiology,"They both stated that they would recommend a bronchoscopy at this time as that is a very invasive procedure and the patient was really without complaints then maintaining normal oxygen saturation on room air. Therefore it was decided to just have IR drained her pleural effusion. The patient did improve drastically after the chest tube in her left lung was placed and on repeat chest x-ray, it did not show any further mucus or bronchus plugging."

3519,T4,thyroxine,"We should note patient had a TSH level of 0.20. She is on levothyroxine replacement at 100 mcg daily and it has been in the proper range in the past as she indicates without signs or symptoms of hyperthyroidism. We will have her get a follow-up TSH and free T4 in the next 2-3 weeks at Dr. _%#NAME#%_'s office. In addition, during the course of evaluation the patient had a biliary scan that showed uptake in the gallbladder and small bowel visualization although the gallbladder ejection fraction seem to be decreased."
3520,T4,thyroxine,"A renal consult was obtained and they suggested a captopril renogram, which was normal. They also did thyroid studies. TSH was 5.10 and free T4 was 1.26, both normal. A p.m. cortisol was 11.4, which is normal. Renin, aldosterone, and catecholamines were sent and are pending at the time of this dictation."
3521,T4,tumor stage 4,"The pathology reports were reviewed. Dr. _%#NAME#%_ spoke directly with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ concerning this patient's care. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 56-year-old female initially diagnosed with a T4, N2 infiltrating ductal carcinoma of her left breast. Her initial treatment was a neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by bilateral mastectomy."
3522,T4,thyroxine,"Suggest sputum culture which I ordered. 7. In view of the possibility of hyperthyroidism, check free T3, free T4 and TSH. 8. Appointment with Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ in one month and the patient plans to keep this appointment."
3523,T4,thyroxine,I suspect this may relate to subclinical hypothyroidism. PLAN: 1. Psychiatric intervention as per Dr. _%#NAME#%_. 2. Add T3 and T4 to screening labs. 3. Milk of Magnesia p.r.n. 4. Resume Flonase two sprays each nostril daily. 5. Screening nocturnal oxymetry study to assess for periods of nocturnal desaturation.
3524,T4,tumor stage 4,"ASSESSMENT: In summary, Mr. _%#NAME#%_ is a 65-year-old gentleman with a large nonsmall cell lung cancer in the right upper lobe, T4N3MX. It has extensively invaded the right hilum and mediastinum (T4 disease). He also has a large pretracheal lymph node, N2. Upon careful reviewing of his CT scan it appears that he might also have a right supraclavicular lymph node, N3(although this was not palpable upon physical examination)"
3525,T4,thyroxine,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, per Dr. _%#NAME#%_. A low TSH being 0.27. Will order a free T4 tomorrow in the a.m. 2. Hypertension, stable, for which she takes Zestril at 20 mg in the a.m. The patient's blood pressure is 105/66."
3526,T4,thyroxine,"LABORATORY DATA: Labs on admission include a Chem-18 remarkable for BUN of 36, creatinine 1.12. CBC is essentially normal. Urinalysis is normal. TSH is 7.74. T4 is normal at 1.43. A chest x-ray and EKG are ordered and are pending."
3527,T4,thyroxine,"The patient should continue on his Nexium and also prescribed a new medication called Librax to help with the frequent stooling. PROBLEM #2: Low TSH. However, the free T4 level is normal at 1.10. Recommend that he follow up with primary to recheck a thyroid level. No need for therapy at this time."
3528,T4,thyroxine,"Our plan was to follow- up on those in the office, but the patient had spent some time in transitional care unit, and further workup was n ot done up to this date. The patient was found to have a free T4 of 2.5 and a TSH of 0._3, which would indicate hypothyroidism. It is possible that this has played a role in the osteoporosis."
3529,T4,thyroxine,"The tumor size was somewhat nonspecific given the multifocal nature of the lesion. However, the depth of invasion through the colonic wall (through the serosal surface) indicated a T4 lesion. Two of 19 sampled pericolonic lymph nodes were positive for a local metastatic spread (N1 nodal disease) and both resected ovaries were also found to be involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma (i.e., M1 status; local metastasis)."
3530,T4,thyroxine,"2. History of some type of thyroid surgery. She was on replacement at one time, but she has been off Synthroid for several months. Her current thyroid-stimulating hormone is 2.05, which is euthyroid. I will check a free T4 and T3 and continue to evaluate at this time. I will continue to hold they Synthroid and have the patient follow-up in 4 months if we do not restart of if we restart medications."
3531,T4,thyroxine,Plan was at some point in time in the near future to do a stress test and then carry out possible cardioversion after roughly six weeks of anticoagulation therapy. Thyroid function studies revealed a normal TSH and a slightly low free T4. Cholesterol levels were in excellent range. Renal function studies were normal including creatinines in the range of .7 to .8 and her blood sugars were normal.
3532,T4,thyroxine,"A Neurology consult was obtained and they recommended continuation of antihypertensive medication and continuation of aspirin. During this admission, a thyroid ultrasound was obtained which was completely normal. T4 and TSH levels are pending at the time of this dictation. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 25 mg one p.o. q day, aspirin 325 mg one p.o. q day, Prilosec 20 mg one p.o. q day, nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual tablets p.r.n. The patient is informed to follow-up with his primary physician in the next two weeks."
3533,T4,thyroxine,"He believes that he has had his dose adjusted once or twice although details are not available to me at present. Mother was not available for confirmation of this. We will plan to check a T3 and T4. Likely the patient will require decrease of his Levoxyl dosing and recheck of the TSH in a month's time. 3. Upper respiratory infection, likely viral in etiology. Recommend use of Sudafed on a p.r.n. basis as well as Robitussin p.r.n. I will be available to follow-up should further issues arise during hospitalization."
3534,T4,thyroxine,"The abnormal update in T9 and L1 corresponded to a fracture seen on plain film, but there was no correspondence with abnormal uptake in T4 and T5. An MRI of the spine was done to follow up bone scan results and to get a better visualization of the thorax."
3535,T4,thyroxine,"_%#NAME#%_ could have pituitary disease. Alternatively, she may simply have narcotic induced suppression of ACTH. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, MD Endocrinology and Diabetes __________________________________________ Labs reviewed. FSH and LH low, Prolactin 70, TSH and free T4 WNL. It remains unclear whether she has pituitary disease or narcotic related suppression of ACTH and cortisol. Would recommend pituitary MRI, stopping opium and narcotic s and checking morning cortisol and ACTH."
3536,T4,thyroxine,"PROBLEM #7: Endocrine: The patient was seen during the hospitalization due to having problems with sweating throughout the day and night. Endocrine was consulted on _%#MMDD2007#%_ and recommended TSH, free T4, T3, total testosterone and pretestoterone and AM cortisol. The labs came back with a low AM cortisol and TSH. Endocrine is subsequently recommended checking an LH and FSH, which came back as high."
3537,T4,thyroxine,"However, he did have a free thyroxin level which was in the normal range at 1.32. Therefore, it was felt that he is a euthyroid sick patient or else may be becoming hypothyroid. However, his free T4 has not become low yet. We recommend that his primary physician follow this as an outpatient. PROBLEM #4: Mild left upper quadrant pain. Patient did complain of some mild left upper quadrant pain."
3538,T4,thyroxine,"ABDOMEN: Soft, nondistended, nontender. MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION: Per Dr. _%#NAME#%_. LABORATORY DATA: Labs today included an unremarkable chem 18. TSH is 0.3. T4 is normal, CBC is unremarkable."
3539,T4,thyroxine,"SKIN: Intact and normal. LABORATORY DATA: Remarkable for abnormal low sodium at 129, BUN 50 and creatinine 1.98. GFR variable between 22-25. TSH was elevated at 20.40. Free T4 was within normal range. Troponin I was elevated at 11. EKG showed very slow heart rate and complete AV heart block."
3540,T4,thyroxine,"Will hold Actose which the patient complains that is what is causing her blood glucose too high. Will check INR, electrolytes frequently if needed. Will obtain also TSH and T4 in the morning. Watch closely her Bg levels and avoid hypoglyceia, and use hypoglycemia protocol and discontinuation of insulin infusion."
3541,T4,thyroxine,2. _%#NAME#%_ will follow up in Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic in approximately two weeks. He does need a repeat TSH and T4 prior to that clinic visit. DIET: Low sodium diet. It was a pleasure to be involved in _%#NAME#%_'s medical care.
3542,T4,thyroxine,"2. Goiter. The patient will have a chest x-ray which if it shows no signs of tracheal deviation and her T4 is not significantly elevated, she would be cleared for potential surgery if her hypothyroidism was treated. I will wait for a T4 before we begin any treatment. The patient's goiter is not substernal and I feel that no further imaging is needed. The patient would be at risk for acute hyperthyroidism if she received iodinated contrast."
3543,T4,thyroxine,"RECTAL: Heme negative. LABORATORY STUDIES: White blood cell count of 10.5, hemoglobin 15.5, hematocrit of 45.5, platelets of 290, MCV of 87, sodium is 137, potassium is 3.7. Chloride is 103, CO2 of 26, BUN of 15, creatinine of 0.8, glucose of 93, calcium is 8.3, INR 1. PTT of 29, TSH is 1.54, free T4 is 1.27. EKG showed a sinus rhythm, T-wave inversions in AVL and flattening of T-waves in V6, otherwise completely normal."
3544,T4,tumor stage 4,"She has several additional right upper lobe nodules, most of which are not PET avid; however, at least 1 nodule in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe shows high SUV. Thus, she has at least 2 tumor masses within the same lobe, namely right upper lobe, making her disease a stage T4. Although her mediastinoscopy revealed no malignancies at station 7, 4R and 4L, her PET CT scan did appear to show evidence of of station 4L involvement, suspicious for N2 disease."
3545,T4,thoracic (level) 4,"An MRI was performed and showed a tumor growing into the spinal cord at the level of T5, as well as compression fractures of T4 and T12. The MRI also showed that his pulmonary lesions had doubled in size over the last month. He was treated with high-dose steroids over 48 hours, from which he is currently being weaned."
3546,T4,thyroxine,"Gonorrhea negative. First trimester screen negative with negative AFP. Varicella immune. One-hour GCT of 155; 3-hour GTT abnormal. Negative GBS. TSH of 3.39. Free T4 and T4 within normal limits. OB ULTRASOUND: 1. _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2005, first trimester screen, normal findings."
3547,T4,thyroxine,She also had mentioned that she had a problem with her thyroid in the past. A TSH was checked which was slightly low at 0.24. A free T4 was then obtained which was normal at 1.21 and the question of possibly an early Hashimoto's thyroiditis or other problem was discussed and that she will need follow-up for this as an outpatient.
3548,T4,thyroxine,"She did maintain the Synthroid through last fall, but did run out of refills and did not call the office. Consistent with her hypothyroid status now is a free T4 from yesterday morning of 0.45 with a TSH of 18. I have since restarted her Synthroid IV at 0.075 mg per day."
3549,T4,thyroxine,"She has remained clinically euthyroid during the last few months, but during this hospitalization, was noted to have abnormal thyroid function tests. TSH was suppressed to less than 0.03 and the free T4 was high normal at 1.65. The patient states she has not had a goiter. She also denied having any dysphagia, voice change or cough."
3550,MR,magnetic resonance,He was seen by Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ (Orthopedics) and was to follow up with him in his office for further treatment. He also had an elevated lipase which was rather persistent. He did go through an MR of the abdomen which showed no evidence of bilary tract disease or pancreatic inflammation. He is not a user of alcohol. His lipase eventually did return to normal.
3551,MR,mitral regurgitation,"An echocardiogram was done in the hospital today showing a technetium approximated EF of 20 percent to 25 percent, anteroseptal apical akinesia, severe inferoseptal and posterior hyperkinesia. He has mild MR, mild TR, mild aortic and mitral leaflet sclerosis, and mild mitral annular calcification. Left atrial dilation was noted. Since admission, he has been asymptomatic."
3552,MR,magnetic resonance,Whether or not she can have an MRI scan will depend on the type of valve. Radiology will be contacted about the ability to perceive with MR imaging. She states that she has already had MRI scan since the valve was replaced. MR angiogram of circle of Willis will be carried out as well.
3553,MR,magnetic resonance,"She had carotid ultrasound which was normal. She had an MRI/MRA of her brain which showed one 5 mm potential abnormal focus of contrast enhancement in the inferior medial right temporal lobe seen only on a single image. Incidental small venous angioma in the right posterior frontal region. Remainder of the brain is negative. Normal MR angiogram of the intracranial vessel. The patient had follow-up thin sliced, pre and post contrast coronal and post contrast axial images for the area of possible abnormal enhancement in the right inferior frontal medial temporal region."
3554,MR,magnetic resonance,"She had a repeat colonoscopy today, and again, there were changes consistent with acute ischemic colitis. Of note, she had an MR angiogram in _%#MM#%_ 2007, and there was no evidence for arterial atherosclerosis or acute thrombosis. For workup of ischemic colitis, she had a number of studies in _%#MM2007#%_."
3555,MR,mitral regurgitation,"LABS: Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 60%. There was mild LVH, mild pulmonary hypertension, mild TR and MR noted as well. Myoglobin 52, initial troponin was less than 0.07, next 0.09 and next is 0.09, sodium 143, potassium 4.1, chloride 113, CO2 24, BUN 16, creatinine 1.20. CBC revealed a hemoglobin of 10.1, white blood cell count of 4.6, hematocrit 32.7, platelets at 78."
3556,MR,magnetic resonance,"RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Course of antibiotics for 7-10 days until symptoms resolve, and then a period of observation, perhaps two weeks, to be sure there is no recurrence of his diverticulitis. 2. We will have a CT reformatted or repeat for an MR angiogram. I suspect that he is a suitable candidate for an endovascular repair, and I have discussed the alternatives of open and endovascular repair in detail with the patient."
3557,MR,mitral regurgitation,There was an occlusion of the right but a widely patent saphenous vein to the distal right and a 75% stenosis of the PDA. A ventriculogram showed an EF of 55% with 1+ MR and elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. He was admitted in _%#MM2003#%_ with renal failure and had transient dialysis. I believe at that time. He has had a TIA and a carotid endarterectomy on the right and was told that his left carotid was totally occluded.
3558,MR,mitral regurgitation,"_%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ will have admission within the next week. INDICATION FOR ADMISSION: Right and left heart catheterization with assessment of coronary anatomy, right heart pressures, aortic valve assessment, and LV function assessment with attention to MR. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 78-year-old man who is admitted in anticipation of having aortic valve replacement because of progressive deterioration in exertional abilities with dyspnea on exertion increasing the ease of dyspnea."
3559,MR,magnetic resonance,No evidence of infarct was noted. MRA of the head showed a widely patent superior sagittal sinus with no evidence of thrombosis. MR venogram was therefore normal. The patient was seen in consultation by neurosurgery and thought to have a right falcine subdural hematoma versus apparent parenchymal bleed which may have been traumatic in nature.
3560,MR,magnetic resonance,"His workup has included initial CT scan of the head which was unremarkable. MRI scan of the brain performed last night demonstrated no acute changes. MR angiogram of the circle of Willis was described as being normal. Laboratory studies include a CBC, sedimentation rate, electrolytes, glucose, BUN, creatinine, troponin I, and myoglobin, all of which were normal."
3561,MR,mitral regurgitation,"White count 12,000. Hemoglobin 10.9. Since admission, an echocardiogram was done. This showed mild pulmonary hypertension with an RVSP of 37 mmHg plus right atrial pressure. She had mild MR, well-preserved LVR and systolic function, mild LVH, mild left atrial dilation, moderate TR with normal RV systolic function. The past medical history includes: 1. Remote history of skin grafting."
3562,MR,magnetic resonance,"The patient was taken as quickly as possible to radiology where she underwent a cervical CT scan because the MRI scan was not available. The CT showed a narrow canal at the cervical level. She was taken emergently across the river to the University campus MR scanner where suboptimal images were obtained because of patient movement. Cervical, thoracic and lumbosacral segments were imaged again with poor quality films."
3563,MR,mitral regurgitation,"IMPRESSION: 1. Recurrent cardiomyopathy. 2. Nonischemic cardiomyopathy with a thallium study showing no scars, no ischemia and ejection fraction of 20%, 25-30% by echo. 3. Obesity. 4. Obstructive sleep apnea. 5. Moderate MR and moderate TR with mild pulmonary hypertension. PLAN: 1500 calorie day diet, outpatient cardiac rehabilitation, relentless gentle exercise and gradually working up to a 45-60 minutes a day with diet, weight loss and exercise."
3564,MR,magnetic resonance,"He did have an MRI scan of the brain which demonstrated nonspecific small vessel changes but no evidence of acute or subacute stroke. MR angiogram of the circle of Willis and the neck vessels was normal. He states that shortly after admission to the hospital, his symptoms did resolve."
3565,MR,mitral regurgitation,Echocardiogram revealed decreased ejection fraction of 20% with severe left ventricular dysfunction. There is mild right ventricular dysfunction with moderate MR and mild TR. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 66-year-old gentleman admitted with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy and dependent inotropes.
3566,MR,GENERAL ENGLISH,"2. Laboratory studies when the patient allows, to help assist renal and hepatic function. 3. CONTINUE DNR/DNI STATUS AS DISCUSSED DURING PREVIOUS HOSPITALIZATIONS. THIS PLAN IS DISCUSSED WITH MR. _%#NAME#%_ AND WITH HIS FAMILY."
3567,MR,magnetic resonance,"RECOMMENDATION: At this time, from a neurologic standpoint we have to proceed with EEG. MRI of the brain will be carried out and look for any structure that correlates to this episode. In addition MR angiography of circle of Willis as well as cervical vessels would be checked. During his hospitalization here, I recommend cardiac monitoring and telemetry."
3568,MR,mitral regurgitation,"ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Chest palpitations. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: AV nodal reentrant tachycardia. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Transthoracic echocardiogram showing normal global left ventricular function, mild MR and an ejection fraction of 55%, with an estimated pulmonary artery pressure of 27 mmHg above mean right atrial pressure. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Fifty-two-year-old female with a history of hypertension and recurrent atrial fibrillation, who awoke on the morning of admission with nausea and palpitations."
3569,MR,myocardial infarction:MI,On the day of admission he had severe chest pressure which quite frightened him and brought him here. He ruled out for an MR. His initial cardiac echo was normal and his EKG was normal. He did have a couple of very mild episodes of his chest pressure.
3570,MR,magnetic resonance,"She was admitted for further evaluation. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was stable throughout her hospitalization. She showed no dramatic increase or decrease in her weakness. Neurology was consulted and suggested further MR imaging of the brain and C-spine. This disclosed a pontine infarct, which was apparent explanation for her increased weakness according to Dr. _%#NAME#%_."
3571,MR,magnetic resonance,"COR: S1, S2 regular, no pedal edema. Her workup includes a CT of the head which reveals chronic age-related changes with no mass effect. MRI scan of the head reveals ossification of the posterior falx, otherwise no significant abnormality. MR angiogram of the circle of Willis was normal. Ultrasound of the carotid artery was unremarkable. Labs thus far included a TSH, glucose, urinalysis and sed rate which are unremarkable."
3572,MR,magnetic resonance,"He could speak. He had some trouble walking. He came promptly to the emergency room. A CT of the head was unremarkable and subsequently about three to four hours after onset, an MRI of the brain and MR angio of the circle of Willis and of the vessels in the neck were all entirely unremarkable. He has no history of previous such episodes. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin low dose."
3573,MR,magnetic resonance,NEUROLOGIC: Cranial nerves II-XII are intact. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient had a negative MR in _%#MM#%_ with her having problems with the lymphedema on the breast. Will get another MR in _%#MM#%_ of next year and will not do mammograms on that breast until it is less tender. I have discussed with her massage technique. I will see her again in three months with labs.
3574,MR,magnetic resonance,"She did need the PCA treatment, but eventually was able to take oral medications to control her pain and was discharged after several days of being in the hospital. It was thought that perhaps her pain was related to a paraneoplastic phenomenon, given the MR results could not seem to adequately explain her symptoms she was having. The patient did followup with Oncology. She was supposed to get chemotherapy, but apparently this was put on hold because of thrombocytopenia."
3575,MR,magnetic resonance,"MRI does not show any evidence of diffusion weighted abnormalities to suggest stroke or TIA. 2. Evidence of high-grade ICA stenosis, versus near occlusion, versus occlusion. The patient needs formal MR angiogram of neck and circle of Willis for further assessment. RECOMMENDATIONS: Proceed with MR angiogram of neck and circle of Willis while patient in the Emergency Room and make further decision about treatment."
3576,MR,magnetic resonance,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Multiple enhancing brain lesions. 2. Renal failure. MAJOR PROCEDURES AND TREATMENTS: 1. MR scan. 2. Dialysis. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. _%#NAME#%_ is a 54-year-old female who was evaluated with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 who has had previous pancreatic and kidney transplants.
3577,MR,magnetic resonance,"MRI scanning of the brain was subsequently performed disclosing evidence of a moderate to large nonhemorrhagic infarct, both in the left posterior frontal and left parietal lobe. His left carotid artery on the MR angiogram revealed either very proximal high-grade stenosis or more likely occlusion. 80-90% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery was also identified."
3578,MR,magnetic resonance,"A carotid ultrasound was performed showing less than 40% stenosis in both carotid artery distributions. The MR angiogram of the neck was essentially unremarkable. MR angiography of the head was also normal. However an MRI scan of the cervical spine showed a recent infarct o the right side of the pons as well as a nonenhancing mass lesion on the right side of the cervical spinal cord at the C2-3 level, etiology indeterminate."
3579,MR,magnetic resonance,"Troponins and ECG were nonischemic. Flat and upright of the abdomen were unremarkable, and she was felt to have a stress gastritis which was responding nicely with antacids. She also had negative MR scan of her head, actually a very good looking MR scan. The patient was treated with antacids and chest x-ray resolved. Neurology saw her and had nothing else to add, felt that this possibly could be related to medicine, she was on some Levaquin for her venous stasis ulcer and that was subsequently stopped."
3580,MR,mitral regurgitation,"This was declining by the time of discharge. The significance is unclear given the patient's severe cardiac disease and renal failure. Given his increasing troponins, we did obtain a cardiac echo, which showed severe global hypokinesis, moderate-to-severe MR and TR, and mild AI and PI. He had 4-chamber enlargement and estimated LVEF of 20% on his echo during this admission."
3581,MR,mitral regurgitation,"The patient also had a transesophageal echo of her heart that showed normal left ventricular function, moderate to severe left atrial enlargement, moderate to severe right atrial enlargement, mild MR left pleural effusion. There was no valvular vegetation identified. The patient also had a chest x-ray done on _%#MM#%_ _%#DD#%_, 2002, that showed a small left pleural effusion by humeral head prosthesis."
3582,MR,mitral regurgitation,"I have told her she may well get stenting or bypass surgery as needed or as directed by our best judgment from a cardiology standpoint in view of her MR and her diminished LV function. IMPRESSION: 1. Newly appreciated cardiomyopathy, likely rather gradual and progressive in nature. 2. Moderately severe mitral regurgitation (MR) by echo. 3. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-30% with wall motion abnormalities, as noted above involving the anteroseptal apical left ventricle."
3583,MR,mitral regurgitation,"PROCEDURES: 1. Cardiac echocardiogram. The results of this showed mild LV dilatation and mild increase in the LV wall thickness, normal systolic function, no regional wall abnormality, trace AR, mild left atrial enlargement, mild MR, and a normal right ventricular size and systolic function. 2. Right heart cardiac catheterization, which showed central venous pressure of 7, PA pressures of 22/2, pulmonary artery rest pressure of 6, with cardiac output of 5.1 with a cardiac index of 2.0. BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57-year- old male, with a past medical history significant for permanent pacemaker for complete heart block, hypertension, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, sarcoidosis, and questionable history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
3584,MR,magnetic resonance,"INR today 1.98. Echocardiogram was done showing ejection fraction of 60%, right to left shunt and changes in the bowels consistent with Marfan syndrome. MRI of the brain with MR angiogram were done and personally reviewed showing old right MCA stroke, evidence of multiple stenosis of carotid and vertebral arteries and left subclavian artery aneurysm measuring 2 cm."
3585,MR,magnetic resonance,Evaluation revealed a critical stenosis of the right anterior carotid artery with a moderate stenosis of the left. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on _%#MMDD2002#%_. MR angiogram confirmed a critical stenosis on the right with a moderate stenosis on the left. The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent a right carotid endarterectomy with external jugular vein-angioplasty.
3586,MR,magnetic resonance,"_%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_ is a 28-year-old female, presenting with a history suggestive of possible complex migraine, possible seizure. HOSPITAL COURSE: Evaluation in hospital included appropriate imaging study inclusive of CT of the head demonstrating a small lipoma in the corpus collosum, MRA of the circle of Willis demonstrating no abnormalities, MR angiogram of the neck with and without contrast demonstrating no abnormalities, MR of the brain with and without contrast entirely normal, aside from the incidental finding of the aforementioned lipoma, MR of the cervical spine demonstrating no evidence of abnormality in the cord or surrounding structures. EKG was found to have normal sinus rhythm. Laboratory studies otherwise inclusive of essentially normal chemistry panel and negative urine drug screen, negative hCG, normal spinal fluid, including normal glucose and protein with no pleocytosis."
3587,MR,mitral regurgitation,"The elevation in troponin was thought secondary to the pneumonia process. Also, a 2D echocardiogram was obtained which showed a normal ejection fraction of 60%, mild MR and mild TR. On the second day of hospitalization, he started having melenic stool. His hemoglobin dropped to 6 from 11. A GI consultation was obtained and patient underwent an upper GI endoscopy in the Intensive Care Unit."
3588,MR,mitral regurgitation,"It was felt that the etiology of her shortness of breath was multifactorial, including restrictive obstructive lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, moderate- to-severe MR, and moderate aortic regurgitation, and also ventricular dysynchrony. DISCHARGE PLAN: She should follow up with her primary care physician, Dr. _%#NAME#%_ _%#NAME#%_, in 1 to 2 weeks. She will also follow up with electrophysiology in 1 month, and she is to undergo a repeat echocardiogram at Fairview in 4 months with cardiology to evaluate left ventricular dimensions and ejection fraction, and for her mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation."
3589,MR,magnetic resonance,"She received postoperative CyberKnife radiotherapy to that site (L1-L2 intradural mass) between _%#MMDD2005#%_ and _%#MMDD2005#%_, a total dose of 300 cGy was delivered to the 85% isodose line. We have now been asked to see Ms. _%#NAME#%_ in consultation because follow-up MR scans of her brain have demonstrated some progression with new contrast enhancement in the medial right occipital lobe, as well as increasing associated edema."
3590,MR,mitral regurgitation,TSH was borderline low. Free T4 and Free T3's are pending at the time of dictation. The patient underwent a cardiac echo which showed a mild sclerotic aortic valve and borderline LVH and trace MR. This was otherwise unremarkable with an ejection fraction of 55-60%. No shunts or clots were seen. The patient was initially rate controlled with Cardizem drip and was given digoxin 0.5 mg.
3591,MR,magnetic resonance,"His gait is changed after the stroke. Since admission, the patient had MRI of the brain with MR angiogram of neck and circle of Willis which I personally reviewed. There is no evidence of acute stroke. There is old right thalamic stroke. MR angiogram of neck and circle of Willis do not show any intracranial stenosis. The patient did have echocardiogram which showed hypokinetic left ventricle and ejection fraction of 45% with no evidence of clots or shunt."
3592,MR,magnetic resonance,"This was followed up with an MRI of the brain, which on diffusion-weighted imaging revealed lesions in the right frontal lobe and right temporal lobe in the distribution of the right middle cerebral artery. These were felt to be compatible with acute infarct and distribution of the right middle cerebral artery. An MR angiogram demonstrated occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery as well, but decreased flow to the anterior branch of the middle cerebral artery and stenosis at the genu of the right middle cerebral artery."
3593,MR,mitral regurgitation,"IMPRESSION/RECOMMENDATIONS: The patient is a pleasant 44-year-old lady who presented with decreased exercise tolerance, along with palpitations and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. She is noted to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. The patient does have severe valvular disease including severe MR and TR with subvalvular restriction likely from rheumatic valvular disease. It is likely the atrial fibrillation is from the MR and thyrotoxicosis and appeared to be chronic."
3594,MR,magnetic resonance,"At present, she is feeling well other than weak. She is not nauseated and denies any headache, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, diarrhea, or bladder symptoms. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Left carotid endarterectomy _%#MM2000#%_. MR angiogram showed an 80% stenosis prior to surgery. 2. Cerebrovascular accident _%#MM1998#%_, resulting in right sided weakness and aphasia. A CT scan showed a large left frontal/parietal infarct. She was treated with Coumadin."
3595,MR,magnetic resonance,For further details of the physical examination please see the fellow's note in the chart. RADIOLOGY: I reviewed an MR scan of his brain showing a diffuse lesion in the pons. This has spectroscopy characteristics felt consistent with a tumor. He has a PET scan that apparently does not show increased metabolic activity in this region.
3596,MR,magnetic resonance,The thickening of the wall as well as the pericholecystic fluid would likely be due to his liver disease. If the question needs further clarification of whether he would be jaundiced from choledocholithiasis an MR cholangiogram would be a good idea. I will follow Mr. _%#NAME#%_ along with you. Thanks for the consultation
3597,MR,magnetic resonance,"SOCIAL HISTORY: He uses no alcohol but he is a smoker. We note that preop serum creatinine is stable at approximately 2.
